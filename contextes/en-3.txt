   as a sign of lack of self-confidence. When eye contact is too
   intensive, your interlocutor may feel intimidated or provoked. In case
   of female-male relationship it might be interpreted sexually.

You can use three basic types of gazes:

   1. The professional gaze – you look at your client’s forehead and in
   their eyes. It’s a good idea to raise your head a little, which will
   create a professional distance. If you lean back and speak in a lower,

   2. The sociable gaze – you follow your client’s face with your eyes.
   This technique makes it easier to establish a relationship. When using
   this technique, it’s important to remember where to focus your gaze.

   intimacy – this is what we subconsciously do when we find a potential
   partner to be attractive, this behavior is a part of the seduction
   ritual. This type of gaze, when applied properly, allows you to move
   from being perceived as an expert to being perceived as someone closer,

   their whole figure and, for example, say: “Oh, these are very nice
   shoes! Where did you buy them?”. It allows you to immediately establish
   a better, more intimate relationship. However, you should remember that

   at the contract, it’s a signal informing that they might be interested
   in reading its terms. Concentrated gaze of your client and their
   dilated pupils indicate a likelihood of enthusiasm. Always carefully
   observe your client’s gaze, it’s a window to a lot of invaluable
   information.
