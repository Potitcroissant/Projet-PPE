Look at My Eyes: Reading gaze in paintings

   Many paintings rely on quite subtle clues as to their reading. Is that
   figure simply a portrait, or are they intended to tell us more, even
   refer to a narrative? What’s going on in this group of people, general
   hubbub or is there something more? In this article I’m going to look at
   the direction of gaze, and tomorrow at hands and gestures such as
   pointing.

   Being visual art, paintings often are at least partly about, or refer
   to, the act of looking. For most painters, this is a central concern in
   their figurative works. A single figure shown looking straight at the
   viewer, or (in more recent paintings in particular) with a fixed gaze
   at an object outside the picture, is most likely to have been posed for
   a straight portrait. Once their gaze is directed at an object or
   another figure, there’s likely to be something else going on.

   The gaze of a single figure can carry important meaning, as in Louise
   Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun’s Life Study of Lady Hamilton as the Cumaean
   Sybil from 1792. Coupled with her ‘eastern’ headdress, distinctive
   robes and scroll, her heavenly gaze tells us that she is under divine
   inspiration.

   One of the most intense painted gazes is that between Gustave Moreau’s
   Oedipus and the Sphinx (1864), which stands in stark contrast to that
   of mother and infant. These two are right in one another’s face,
   staring one another out. The Sphinx is already latched onto what she
   assumes will be her next and delectable young meal, and promises to be

   With larger groups, it’s worth taking the time to consciously examine
   the gaze of each face you can see in the painting.

   lovers, the orator Hypereides, took on her defence. A key part of that
   was to unveil her naked in front of the court, in an attempt to
   surprise its members, impress them with the beauty of her body, and
   arouse a sense of pity. The legend claims that this ploy worked
   perfectly, and with his skill in using gaze, Gérôme’s painting makes
   that crystal clear.

   Hamburg, Germany. Wikimedia Commons.

   Sometimes the importance of gaze lies in what the figures are not
   looking at.

   Henry III, who was largely responsible, had to flee and take refuge
   with Henry of Navarre. The following year Henry III was assassinated by
   an agent of the Catholic League.

   Some of the most fascinating paintings feature complex chains of gaze
   which need more careful study.

   (1900), oil on canvas, 127 × 147 cm, Museum der Bildenden Künste
   Leipzig, Leipzig. Wikimedia Commons.

   The chain of gaze here is central to the painting’s narrative: John’s
   eye stares at Salome, who stares at the executioner’s crotch, who
   laughs at the young woman at the top right, who laughs back at him.
   Watching sombre and detached from behind is the figure of death.

   I end this article with three paintings in which gaze is complex. Two
   probably don’t contain any particular meaning, but the third is one of
   the greatest masterpieces in the history of painting in Europe.

   Benjamin West’s The Treaty of Penn with the Indians or William Penn’s
   Treaty with the Indians was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772.
   This shows the founder of the state of Pennsylvania purchasing land for
   his colony from the Lenape people, with a treaty of peace between the
   colonists and the ‘Indians’, in 1682. Looking at the directions of gaze
   of its figures suggests that the artist had no consistent idea of where
   they should be looking, and the viewer is even hard-put to identify its
   central figure William Penn.

   Wikimedia Commons.In what is overtly a portrait of eleven people and a
   dog in a room in the Alcázar Palace, Velázquez uses composition and
   gaze to tell us much more. Much depends on what we believe most of the
   figures are looking at. Reflected in the rectangular plane mirror on
   the far wall are King Philip IV and his wife Queen Mariana of Austria.

   There has been dispute over whether the reflection shows the royal
   couple stood where the viewer is, or the mirror is reflecting their
   painted images on Velázquez’s canvas. How their images were generated
   is probably of secondary importance, as either way the gaze of most of
   the other figures is clearly directed not at the viewer, but at the
   King and Queen, who may be getting up to leave after sitting for
   Velázquez to paint them.

   [119], oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cm, Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid,
   Spain. Wikimedia Commons.That must be one of the most subtle and
   complex uses of gaze in a painting.

   Tomorrow I look at hands, pointing, and other gestures we can make with
   them.

        Thanks.
            An outstanding painting, of course, but not I think a
            difficult gaze to read. She’s looking directly at the viewer.
            There’s nothing to suggest that she’s looking at anything
            else. Her gaze indicates that this is first and foremost a
            portrait – she posed for the painting, rather than being
            caught ‘unawares’ doing something else, as with many of
            Vermeer’s other single-figure paintings, such as The Milkmaid.
            How you read the rest of that painting is far more complex,
            but there isn’t a great deal more that you can get from the
            direction of her gaze itself, as far as I’m aware.
