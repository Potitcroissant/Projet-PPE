   both empowerment and exploitation. Her work raised questions about
   photographers’ responsibility and subjects’ agency that are still
   debated today.

   The concept of ‘the gaze’ has become central to contemporary art
   criticism, and denotes far more than the act of observation. It
   concerns power dynamics between viewer and viewed, the politics of
   representation and the complex relationship between artist, subject and
   audience. From Orientalist fantasies that reduce cultures to ‘exotic’
   spectacle, to subversive works that challenge long-held perspectives,
   art has long made us consider the ethical implications of looking. This
   week we examine four works that illuminate different aspects of the
   gaze, each revealing how the act of seeing is never neutral but always
   charged with desire and power.

   Constantinople. This romanticised vision obscures reality: almehs were
   in reality sophisticated entertainers, healers and teachers, respected
   for their intellectual as well as physical abilities. Ziem’s painting
   reveals more about European fantasies of ‘the East’ than about its
   actual inhabitants, demonstrating how certain gazes can reduce complex
   cultures to consumable spectacle. Click here to find out more via

   As one of only three women in the Impressionists’ inner circle along
   with Berthe Morisot and Marie Bracquemond, Cassatt brought an unusual
   perspective to the group’s favoured subject of spectatorship. Here she
   presents a woman who actively participates in the ‘game of gazes’
   rather than serving as passive spectacle. The foregrounded figure looks
   on with confident directness while a male observer lurks in the
   background, his gaze registering as secondary to hers. Cassatt’s bold
   composition is an elegant example of how women artists could subtly
   challenge patriarchal conventions of looking. Click here to discover
