“Would that be dangerous, to not look while being looked at?”

― Helen Oyeyemi, The Icarus Girl

   According to Greek mythology, those who gazed into Medusa’s eyes would
   turn to stone. But what changes if, instead, we say that Medusa
   possessed the ability to turn anyone she gazed at to stone? The
   question lies in establishing the difference between what it means to
   see and what it means to look. ‘To see’ can be defined as noticing or
   becoming aware or someone or something, whereas ‘to look’ is to direct
   your gaze in a specified direction. Looking is an active movement that
   requires intent, as opposed to the passive process of seeing.

   This distinction is important because it allows us to reframe the space
   that Medusa occupies in classical mythology. The story goes that, after
   being raped by Poseidon, the beautiful Medusa is the one that receives
   the punishment; Athena turns her into a monstrous Gorgon, with snakes
   for hair and a deadly gaze. She is feared and seen as a hideous threat.
   However, if you have to gaze into her eyes – in other words, make eye
   contact with her – to be petrified, you don’t turn to stone because you
   see or looked at her, you turn to stone because she looked at you. In a
   world were women are judged by their appearance, routinely acknowledged
   as objects to be seen and bodies to be looked at, Medusa’s fatal gaze
   can be redefined as an act of defiance rather than one of defence. All
   the men that come before Perseus, the ‘hero’ who beheads her, don’t die
   because her appearance is so horrific to lay eyes on, rather Medusa
   kills them because she reverses the action of the male gaze,
   confronting it with the female gaze. To quote the feminist French
   director and artist Agnès Varda:‘The first feminist gesture is to say:
   “OK, they’re looking at me. But I’m looking at them.” The act of
   deciding to look, of deciding that the world is not defined by how
   people see me, but how I see them.’

   the subject of male

   fantasies (see Franz Stuck’s Judith (1928)). To what extent can a woman
   be depicted as empowered by her sexuality if she is a product of the
   male gaze? Do we look at Gustav Klimt’s Judith I differently to Tina
   Blondell’s I’ll make you shorter by a head (Judith I)?

   father, also an artist. Although they portray the same moment of the
   story, the slight differences illustrate how depiction varies depending
   on whether the same subject is represented through the male or female
   gaze.

   grey and lifeless severed head. Instead, by painting Judith’s bold
   stance with the sword gripped over her shoulder, she becomes a
   self-assertive protagonist.

   The male gaze – defined as the perspective of a notionally typical
   heterosexual man considered as embodied in the audience or intended
   audience for films and other visual media, characterized by a tendency
   to objectify or sexualize women – overwhelmingly determines how women
   are portrayed and therefore seen. Like in the case of Artemisia, the

   If the worth of a woman is established in terms of men, it is also
   established in terms of how she is seen by men. This objectification
   and idealisation leads to girls growing up, seeking validation from the
   male gaze. Until recently, I felt like my body wasn’t mine, like it had
   been appropriated by society for the purpose of reflecting its
   normative standards. I wanted to be seen how society wanted to see me.
   It’s easy to feel as though the way I see myself is completely divorced
   from how I think people see me and it’s also easy to decide to change

   She states that the figures in her work ‘are fully aware of their
   conspicuousness and are unmoved by the viewer. Their role is not to
   show, explain, or perform but rather “to be.” In being, their presence
   is acknowledged and their significance felt.’ The gaze of the figure in
   Carma directly confronts the viewer, forcing us to consider how our own
   conscious or unconscious biases affect the way we look at her. The
   viewer is made complicit in the act of looking from the perspective of
   the voyeur and challenged by the figure:

   like we exhibit art – the images we post are there to be looked at. In
   these spaces, women are still seen as objects of desire and in art
   history this is exemplified by the tradition of the female nude,
   whereby the female naked body was presented as an object to satisfy a
   man’s gaze. Increasingly, this has been called into question, and one
   woman that reverses the gendered portrayals of the nude is the Welsh
   artist Sylvia Sleigh (1916-2010).

   Her work subverts this form of painting by depicting nude men in poses
   that were historically ascribed to women, subjecting nude men to the
   male gaze. She also equalizes the roles of men and women. For example,
   in the painting above she repaints Titian’s work, portraying all the
   figures as nudes, rather than just the women. Sleigh has affirmed that
   ‘I feel that my paintings stress the equality of men and women (women
   and men). To me, women were often portrayed as sex objects in

   Challenging the way women are seen in art, and by extension society,
   makes us challenge the way we see women/ourselves. I’m 22 now and I can
   feel myself becoming self-aware, regarding how I perceive my identity,
   and critical of the structures that influence the way I am seen. A big
   part of this is acknowledging that my own experience of the male gaze
   and finding my female gaze has been made significantly easier by being
   white and cisgender. The female gaze confronts norms imposed by
   hegemonic masculinity (a practice that legitimizes men's dominant
   position in society), but this is not to say that women are the only
   ones affected by it. Views on gender held by society can be as damaging
   to men as they are to women, and even then, gender should not be
   confined to simply refer to male and female.

   In art, as in reality, the female gaze holds immense power, and after
   being obscured by misogyny,

‘you only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her. And she's not
deadly. She's beautiful and she's laughing.’ (Hélène Cixous, ‘The Laugh of
