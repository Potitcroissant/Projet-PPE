   Join an artist, a historian and a philosopher to explore the concept of
   the gaze within the visual arts​

   In the first of a three-part series responding to the All Too Human
   exhibition, an artist, historian and philosopher explore the concept of
   the gaze within the visual arts, its power to objectify or be
   objective, create intimacy or distance. Speakers include visual artist
   Amalia Ulman, art historian Katharina Guenther and philosopher Timothy
   Secret.
   The panel discussion will be chaired by Dr. Sacha Golob from The Centre
--
   (New York), Intolerance at BARRO (Buenos Aires), Monday Cartoons at
   Deborah Schamoni (Munich), Atchoum! at Galerie Sympa (Figeac) and NEW
   WORLD 1717 at Rockbund Art Museum (Shanghai).

   in the Duffield Room. This two hour seminar explores some of the key
   philosophical issues raised by the notion of the gaze.

   The first half opens with Jean-Paul Sartre's classic discussion: Sartre

   it might be a positive, as well as a negative, phenomenon. The second
   half broadens the discussion to look at the gaze across different
   formats – how should we understand it in the context of painting,
   photography, social media or even writing?
   The session will provide a concise introduction to the core theme and
   its significance for philosophy and the arts. We’ll then break into
