NewsroomWhat is Eye Gaze Technology?

   3/5/2018

   It is an electronic device that allows a person to control a computer
   or tablet by looking at words or commands on a video screen. A very low
   intensity light shines into one of the user’s eyes. A television camera
   picks up reflections from the cornea and retina. As the direction of
   the person’s gaze moves, the relative position of the two reflections
   changes, and the computer uses this information to determine the area
   at which the person is looking. The computer then executes the selected
   command.
