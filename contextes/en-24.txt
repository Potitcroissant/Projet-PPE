   Hollywood cinema. The way shots are composed, the way the camera moves,
   and the way scenes are edited all reinforce patriarchal power
   structures and objectify women.

How the ‘male gaze’ works

   A central tenet of the essay is the concept of the “male gaze”. This
   term has become central to feminist debates, not just in film studies,
   but also in media studies, art theory and advertising.

   Drawing on the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques
--
   objects of male desire.

   Famously, she notes the:

     male gaze projects its phantasy onto the female figure, which is
     styled accordingly […] Women are simultaneously looked at and
     displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic
     impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness.

   This male gaze is comprised of three interconnected “looks”:
    1. the look of the camera: how the film is shot (the framing, camera
       movement, editing and so forth)
    2. the look of the characters: how male characters gaze at female
       characters
    3. the look of the audience: how spectators are positioned to adopt a
       masculine viewpoint.

   When the camera eroticises a woman, when male characters watch her, and
   when the audience shares this view, the male gaze is at its most
   powerful.

   Mulvey frequently uses psychoanalytic terms like “scopophilia” (the
   pleasure of watching) and “voyeurism” (secretly watching for pleasure)

   voyeuristically stalks Kim Novak’s Madeleine. He follows, watches and
   falls in love with a perfect image of female mystery and beauty.
   Hitchcock’s shot selection makes the viewer complicit in his voyeurism.

   We can see the male gaze in slow-motion or lingering shots that focus
   on sexualised aspects of women’s bodies, in lighting and costumes
   designed to emphasise the erotic, or in narratives that halt for a
   moment of female display, before the main plot resumes.

   Cameron Diaz’s first appearance in The Mask (1994) is a clear example
   of the male gaze in full operation.

   Various scholars have challenged Mulvey’s text. Feminist scholar
   Camille Paglia called Mulvey’s argument “simplistic”, saying:

     The idea that a man looking at or a director filming a beautiful
     woman makes her an object, makes her passive beneath the male gaze
     […] I think this was utter nonsense from the start. […] It was an a
     priori theory: first there was feminist ideology, asserting that
     history is nothing but male oppression and female victimization, and
     then came this theory — the “victim” model of feminism applied
--
   Others argue Mulvey failed to take into account spectator diversity, as
   not all viewers are heterosexual men.

   In 1992, American theorist bell hooks coined the term “oppositional
   gaze” to offer a counterpoint to the sexualized, gendered gaze proposed
   by Mulvey that took into account racial power dynamics.

   Mulvey herself has acknowledged these critiques. In her 1990 essay
   Afterthoughts on Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, she revisits her

Mulvey’s legacy

   Mulvey’s concepts from the 1970s can still be applied to contemporary
   films. The male gaze continues to manifest in filmmaking patterns
   designed to align spectators with male characters.

   The James Bond franchise has long presented women characters as
   eroticised objects that exist merely for the hero’s pleasure. And the
   critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049 (2017) was criticised for
   treating female characters as sex objects.

   Terms such as “female gaze” and “queer gaze” have become increasingly
   common on social media and in film analysis.
