   Intuitively, we understand the power of eye contact. We’ve all
   experienced that moment when you look into someone’s eyes and see a
   million unspoken words. From the stern look in your mother’s face when
   the five-year-old you broke into the fridge and ate that tub of ice
   cream, to the scrutinizing gaze of the interviewer as you wondered
   whether you answered that last question well enough to secure the job
   of your dreams.

   The power of the gaze is no mystery. There is a wealth of research
   behind it. Here are the highlights of what eye contact does.
    1. It’s arousing. Looking into someone’s eyes will make you
       significantly more aroused than looking at someone whose gaze is
       averted.^1 Simply having someone stare back at you could make you
       all sweaty and shit.^2 This should be obvious even without the
       research: if you want to arouse someone, don’t look at the floor,
       look at them.

   Regardless, the unconscious mind is always seeking out things it finds
   interesting or intriguing, so if their eyes keep falling on you, it’s a
   sign.

Level 5: The Gaze

   The Gaze is the last level that can occur unconsciously although it’s
   usually conscious. This is when someone looks at you and just keeps
   looking at you past the normal “look away” moment. This is a solid 2-3
   seconds of eye contact without them breaking it. When undesired, this
   becomes the infamous “creep stare.” But in the cases of desirable
   people looking at you, this is extremely good news.

   This is why it’s so important to get in the habit of being able to hold
   eye contact because otherwise, you’ll miss out on all of the people
   giving you Level 3-5 eye contact. The Gaze is a clear and large sign of
   interest. You’d be pretty dumb to pass up this signal.

Level 6: The Smile

   The sixth level of eye contact is The Gaze plus a smile. If The Gaze is
   a clear sign telling you that they’re interested, throwing a smile on
   top of it may as well be a neon flashing billboard. If someone you find
   attractive gives you Level 6 and you don’t talk to them, not only are
   you an idiot, but you probably have some serious anxiety going on.
