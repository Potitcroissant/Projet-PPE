The Male Gaze

   Apr 2
   Written By Rebecca McInerney

   The theory of the male gaze is something that art historians have begun
   to use to explain patterns that have emerged in art over time. One
   common question that presents itself when we look at older art is why
   there are so many nudes used within paintings. This occurrence can be
   attributed mainly, to this theory of the male gaze.

   What’s the story
   The theory of the male gaze is the idea that in the arts and literature
   the world, people, and circumstances are depicted through the
   understanding and preferences of a heterosexual male. This phenomenon
   does not just appear in fine art and is prevalent in any type of
   entertainment media. However, the relevance of the male gaze in art
   history became apparent in the 1970s, along with the emergence of other
   trends that were researched and written about by feminist art
   historians. For art history specifically, the idea of the male gaze is
   referencing the desire of men to create idealized images of women for
   their enjoyment. Also, this does not mean a strictly sexual enjoyment,
   the male gaze is the idea that male artists, and female artists as
   well, painted for a male audience, so they wanted to show scenes and
   situations that would capture the attention of the audience. This
   theory almost proves itself when we realize that once art became
   something that was bought and sold, it had to be marketable to those
   who would have the money to buy art. This happened as early as the
   Renaissance, when the only people who had money were men, so it would
   make sense that artists would paint works that would appeal to their
   targeted market. So, the male gaze grew and encompassed many aspects of
   art.

   Examples of the male gaze emerge often throughout art history. From the
   Renaissance to Contemporary art we can track the male gaze and how it
   has changed through time. One of the first works that we can point to
   as an example of the male gaze is Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus
   [figure 1]. This painting depicts the nude female figure of Aphrodite.
   Although the appearance of the nude in this artwork can be explained
   away as the perfection of the goddess of love, who does not need to
   worry about things like modesty or imperfections, according to the
   artists and authorities of the fifteenth century, this work is still an
   example of the male gaze. Botticelli, among other artists of the
   Renaissance, was painting nudes in order to better understand how to
   draw and paint the human body. That does track as a valid way of
   learning how to depict the human body, but the repetitive depiction of
   female bodies is almost always explained away as a depiction of a
   goddess or a personification of an ideal. This is to say that the works
   of the Renaissance are not directly obvious examples of the male gaze,
   but they are the foundation of the acceptance of depicting nude bodies
   in art.

   One of the most common examples of the male gaze in art is
   Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' Grande Odalisque [figure 2]. This
   painting depicts a nude woman, and she takes up the entirety of the
   picture plane. Unlike any of the other examples presented here, this
   work is solely focused on this woman. It comes off almost like a study
   of women, from an outside perspective. This may be one of the best ways
   to explain the idea of the male gaze. Not only does this seem like a
   study of women, but it is a very intimate scene, that we, as viewers,
   seem to be intruding upon. The woman depicted also has slightly
   elongated proportions, which helps reinforce the idea that this
   painting is an idealized version of life. Realistically, the situation
   that this painting casually presents would not be a situation that any
   viewer could walk in on. This moment is meant to be intimate but is
   instead being shared with every viewer who takes it in. In this way, we
   can see how the male gaze captures a situation and edits it to be an
   idealized situation for a male audience.

   Moving through time, another example of a more nuanced version of the
   male gaze is Édouard Manet's Dejeuner sur l'Herbe [figure 3]. This
   impressionist painting by Manet is showing a picnic, but there is
   something off about some of the sitters. The men are fully clothed but
   the women are completely nude. This too almost seems like the
   personification of the male gaze. The men in this painting, and who
   were intended viewers of this painting, may not see anything remarkable
   about this painting at all, especially at the time it was painted.
   Meanwhile, this painting may have made any woman looking at it very
   uncomfortable imagining herself in that situation. That is another way
   that we can see the male gaze in art. The theory of the male gaze is
   proven when there are paintings that depict scenes or situations in
   which women appear to be a prop or another piece of scenery because
   their presence is not being considered.

   woman. This work is Crying Girl by Roy Lichtenstein [figure 4]. This
   Pop Art print shows just the head of a woman who is crying. In the
   procession of works that I have given as examples so far, this one may
   stand out as confusing or inaccurate, but it illustrates a different
   aspect of the male gaze that arose in the twentieth century. This woman
   is not depicted nude, but her emotions are emphasized, creating the
   idea that every woman is emotional. We can understand that this may not
   actually be the case but from the perspective of the male gaze that
   seems to be the message that is being relayed. Now the interesting
   thing about this work is that it was created in 1964, which means that
   Roy Lichtenstein may actually have created this work to acknowledge the
   male gaze in some sense. As art history moved into Pop Art and Abstract
   Expressionism, artists began to take more responsibility when it came
   to the message they were implying in their art. So, although this may
   capture that aspect of the male gaze, it may be completely on purpose,
   to help the viewer identify it for themselves.

   One more thing that I would like to add (almost as a disclaimer) is
   that pointing out these examples is just a way to point out the theory
   of the male gaze. These works of art that I have talked about today are
   still important works of art in the span of art history. Although they
   may prove this theory, for the most part, we know that the implication
   of the male gaze was a subconscious result of culture and society. If
   you are upset about the appearance of this theory, do not take out your
   frustration on these works of art of the artists that painted them,
   instead focus on promoting and supporting art and artists who do not
   continue to fall into this theory in our modern times.

   Why is it important to art history?
   It’s important to understand the concept of the male gaze because of
   its role in a better understanding of art history. Understanding the
   culture and mindset of the artist helps us explain the why for every
   work of art. Therefore knowing that most artists that we study are male
   creates a necessity for understanding the male gaze as most famous
   artworks were painted with the purpose of serving the male gaze.
   However, once we know this, we can better adjust our own looking
   experiences and view art from an unbiased point of view.

   How can you form your own perspective?

   A close friend of mine, who is a guy, has asked me quite a few times
   why he’s drawn to art that features nude women. This is a great
   question that is hopefully answered in what I’ve written about here.
   Understanding the male gaze actually helps to explain many of our
   preferences when it comes to art. So, ask yourself, has the theory of
   the male gaze affected which works of art you gravitate towards? Do you
   look at the world differently once you can recognize the male gaze? Can
   you form your own, unique gaze on the world?
