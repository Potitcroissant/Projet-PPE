   Male Gaze (trope)
   Oh? What's in her pocket?
   Meryl: I'll go on ahead, look at my ass.
   Snake: Okay. Cool.

   The Male Gaze is a form of Gaze that arises from the assumption that
   the audience is mostly composed of straight males, which in turn means
   female fanservice will appear in some form to appeal to or appease said
   male audience.

   The usual result of Male Gaze is the way a (usually male) director
   and/or cameraman's interest in women shapes his shots, leading to a
   focus on breasts, legs, buttocks, and other jiggly bits even when the
   film isn't necessarily supposed to be a feast for eyes of their
   admirers (though most of the time this can indeed be intentional). For

   become Eating the Eye Candy, though not necessarily.)

   The term also applies in other media, such as video games and comic
   books. During the Dark Age, comic books were (and often still are)
   perfect examples of the male gaze, with scenes being framed to show off
   a female character's curves over everything else. It can occur in
   non-visual media too - when a female character is introduced, the
   narration will often spend a disproportionate amount of words on
   describing her appearance.

   Male Gaze does sometimes focus on male attributes, focusing on big
   pumping biceps and perfect abs, but, crucially, in a way that is
   sexless and aspirational. The presumed male audience is intended to
   relate to the character being objectified in this way and wish they had
   that body themselves, rather than desire the character.

   The Distaff Counterpart of the Male Gaze is the Female Gaze — where the
   same rules as above apply except the focus is on more traditionally
   masculine qualities in a character.

       Advertising
     * A Coke commercial featured a trio of guys at a party with a trio of
       girls. The viewer does not see any of the girls' faces, and the
       camera focuses solely on their tight clothing.
     * The Brazilian Butt Lift Commercials are full of Male Gaze.
       Admittedly, this is a service that would be difficult to sell
       without use of Male Gaze.
     * Evony's banner ads feature little more than a pair of gigantic
       boobs accompanied by the words "Play now, my lord!" or "Save your
       lover the Queen!" or "One click for a Roman Orgy!". Evony is a
       Civilization-esque strategy game.

       Naturally, her response is an unamused "eyes up here" gesture.
          + Their ads are [external_link.gif] ostensibly aimed at women.
            Maybe gay/bi women are a huge target audience for Reebok?
     * An advertisement for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia played with
       this trope, showing the male gaze until the camera pans up
       revealing the woman in question to be the hideous (under the
       makeup, the actress is rather attractive) Margaret McPoyle.
     * Played with in a Jean-Paul Gautier perfume campaign. The ad for the
       male perfume is typical male-gaze: a sailor leaves a woman after a
       night of passion; she's shown half naked, writhing in the sheets.
       The ad for the female perfume is exactly the same, except it's the
       woman leaving and the sailor writhing half naked in the sheets.
     * In Killing Us Softly: Advertising's View of Women, her major
       lecture series, Jean Kilbourne argues that the male gaze is so
       pervasive in modern culture, particularly advertising, that it has
       changed the way that women look at each other - that even
       heterosexual women look at other women in the way that a
       heterosexual man would.

     * Doing It Right This Time:
          + Shinji is constantly staring at Asuka and Rei.
          + Chapter 2 gave an example that amusingly combined this with
            Female Gaze: the three pilots go to buy new clothes, Rei tries
            a new dress... and Shinji and Asuka cannot take their eyes off
            her, noticing how the dress clings to her body and shows her
            curves.
     * In Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus, Harry Potter has often

     * Ratatouille: After Linguini and Colette get together, there's a
       slow pan-up of Colette as they work in the kitchen, presumably from
       Linguini's perspective.
     * The Super Mario Bros. Movie: Peach gets a fair amount of gaze
       moments thanks to all of them being from Mario's point-of-view. One
       notable moment is done as the heroes get into karts and drive past
       some nice scenery, with the camera following Mario's eyes as Peach
       revs in front of him, her biker suit putting her rear on full

     * Zootopia:
          + Some scenes focus on Judy Hopps's butt, especially when she
            tries to get on a chair.
          + Gazelle is a much bigger contender here, given that some shots
            give focus to her chest and her hind, especially whenever she
            performs on stage.

       Literature
     * Roman Kendar's POV scenes in City of No End have a few Male Gaze
       moments, particularly when he meets Sibyla Leibowitz and when the
       Norns bring out singers to entertain him on his diplomatic mission.
       This doesn't happen in scenes from the POV of other characters,
       however.

       phrases like "flawless breasts", "supple body", "luscious mouth".
       Doesn't help that they are often threatened with rape by pirates or
       savages every few chapters as well.
     * A short story by French author Anna Gavalda centers around the Male
       Gaze. The protagonist, a single woman, goes to the bar in search of
       some fun. A man starts talking to her boobs, but she refuses to
       acknowledge him. He even switches language from French to English,
       before he thinks to look two decimeters higher. "Fancy that! I have
       a face, too!" she thinks, before telling him off.

       there is no man around. For some reason all the characters also
       seems to have the same standards of beauty, and write off women who
       are too fat or too skinny as impossible love interests for the
       victim, since "she could never be the subject of a young man's
       lustful gaze".
     * John Carter of Mars is an officer and a gentleman. Except for a
       reference to Dejah Thoris' 'perfectly symmetrical figure' and an
       occasional 'bare shoulder' you would never guess he is surrounded
       by pulchritudinous damsels clad in nothing more than leather straps

     * Gammla, the Shallow Love Interest of Quest for Fire is framed
       almost entirely though this lens unfortunately. Interestingly
       though, because this is specifically a male neanderthal gaze, it
       often lingers on parts of the body not traditionally considered
       beautiful by modern man such as her hairy arms and round belly.

     * In Shadowboy, the narrator is a Hormone-Addled Teenager, leading to

     * The Honorverse is actually very good about avoiding this.... except
       when it comes to Eloise Pritchart, one of the later series' anchor
       characters. This is less "Male Gaze" and more "Everyone's Gaze",
       though, as she really is apparently just that gorgeous — something
       which every character who personally meets her for the first time
       will invariably dwell upon for a paragraph or two before moving on
       with the plotline. To the author's credit, this does not in any way

       like her butt, her thighs, and her breasts while the camera pans
