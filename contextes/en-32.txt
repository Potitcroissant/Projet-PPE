A Beginner's Guide to The Gaze

   The gaze – or the male gaze, more specifically – is a discourse that
   disects how we look at visual representations in film, advertising and
   art. Coined by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey in her seminal 1975
   essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, Laura argues that
   persepctives in visual media are often built from the viewpoint of a

   is that women are often depicted in a sexualised way, where their value
   is judged based on their appearance. At its heart, women are viewed as
   objects of male desire. On 21 Nov, curator Lola de la Mata has
   programmed an evening which explores and challenge this notion of the
   gaze.

Through another’s eyes

   One way of understanding the male gaze in action is to consider you as
   the viewer. Take for example the painting below:

Behind the camera

   But the concept of the gaze goes much further than just the position of
   the viewer. Women have often been viewed as submissive characters in
   film, advertising and visual media in other ways. For example, nearly

   and Antonio Branco, Q-Hubris addresses the power dynamics in the
   relationship between idol and worshipper, inviting the audience to
   consider their objectification of the performers. Through covering a
   near-naked body in gold leaf, the pair use daring costume and
   confrontational movement to address the gaze, both upon each other and
   from the audience. Q-Hubris also takes the concept of the male gaze
   beyond gender, exploring the power structures of the superior and
   submissive throughout society: between pop stars and fans, white people
   and every other race, those who identify as cis/heterosexual and the
   LGBTQ+ community.

   Prominent both historically and in contemporary media, the male gaze
   inevitably influences the way that not only men, but women perceive and
   relate to other women and themselves, reinforcing the objectification
   of women, both in art and  in society. See how Lola de la Mata turns
   the concept of the gaze on it’s head in her discussion about the
   curatorial process.
