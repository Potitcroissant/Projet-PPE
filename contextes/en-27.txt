   of times a participant looked up and to the right, or up and to the
   left. These movements were coded and compared to what NLP experts
   hypothesized.

   Study results did not support the hypotheses that upper right gaze
   indicates lying. Nor that looking up and to the left indicates
   truthfulness.

   In the second experiment, 50 participants were split into two equal
--
   detection claims.

   In the final experiment, two independent raters watched videos of known
   liars and truth tellers. Of all the videos viewed by the raters, there
   were no instances of upper left or upper right gazes.

   None of these studies provide any evidence that the NLP theory of eye
   movement and lie detection are reliable or accurate.
