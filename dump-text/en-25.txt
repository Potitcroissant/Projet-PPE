Why meeting another’s gaze is so powerful

   The reaction when two people lock eyes in a crowded room is a staple of
   romantic cinema. But the complex, unconscious reactions that take place
   are anything but make believe.

   You’ve doubtless had the experience when, across a noisy, crowded room,
   you lock gazes with another person. It’s almost like a scene out of the
   movies – the rest of the world fades to grey while you and that other
   soul are momentarily connected in the mutual knowledge that they are
   looking at you and you at them.

   Of course, eye contact is not always so exciting – it’s a natural part
   of most casual conversations, after all – but it is nearly always
   important. We make assumptions about people’s personalities based on
   how much they meet our eyes or look away when we are talking to them.
   And when we pass strangers in the street or some other public place, we
   can be left feeling rejected if they don’t make eye contact.

   This much we already know from our everyday experiences. But
   psychologists and neuroscientists have been studying eye contact for
   decades and their intriguing findings reveal much more about its power,
   including what our eyes give away and how eye contact changes what we
   think about the other person looking back at us.

   You might also like:

   For instance, a recurring finding is that gazing eyes grab and hold our
   attention, making us less aware of what else is going on around us
   (that ‘fading to grey’ that I mentioned earlier). Also, meeting
   someone’s gaze almost immediately engages a raft of brain processes, as
   we make sense of the fact that we are dealing with the mind of another
   person who is currently looking at us. In consequence, we become more
   conscious of that other person’s agency, that they have a mind and
   perspective of their own – and, in turn, this makes us more
   self-conscious.

   You may have noticed these effects particularly strongly if you’ve ever
   held the intense gaze of a monkey or ape at a zoo: it is almost
   impossible not to be overcome by the profound sensation that they are a
   conscious being judging and scrutinising you. In fact, even looking at
   a portrait painting that appears to be making eye contact has been
   shown to trigger a swathe of brain activity related to social cognition
   – that is, in regions involved in thinking about ourselves and others.

   Not surprisingly, the drama of realising we are the object of another
   mind is highly distracting. Consider a recent study by Japanese
   researchers. Volunteers looked at a video of a face while
   simultaneously completing a word challenge that involved coming up with
   verbs to match various nouns (to take an easy example, if they heard
   the noun ‘milk”, a suitable response would be “drink”). Crucially, the
   volunteers struggled much more at the word challenge (but only for the
   trickier nouns) when the face in the video appeared to be making eye
   contact with them. The researchers think this effect occurred because
   eye contact – even with a stranger in a video – is so intense that it
   drains our cognitive reserves.

   Similar research has found that meeting the direct gaze of another also
   interferes with our working memory (our ability to hold and use
   information in mind over short periods of time), our imagination, and
   our mental control, in the sense of our ability to suppress irrelevant
   information. You may have experienced these effects first hand, perhaps
   without realising, whenever you have broken eye contact with another
   person so as to better concentrate on what you are saying or thinking
   about. Some psychologists even recommend looking away as a strategy to
   help young children answer questions.
   Too much eye contact can also make us uncomfortable and people who
   stare without letting go can come across as creepy

   As well as sending our brains into social overdrive, research also
   shows that eye contact shapes our perception of the other person who
   meets our gaze. For instance, we generally perceive people who make
   more eye contact to be more intelligent, more conscientious and sincere
   (in Western cultures, at least), and we become more inclined to believe
   what they say.

   Of course, too much eye contact can also make us uncomfortable – and
   people who stare without letting go can come across as creepy. In one
   study conducted at a science museum, psychologists recently tried to
   establish the preferred length of eye contact. They concluded that, on
   average, it is three seconds long (and no one preferred gazes that
   lasted longer than nine seconds).

   Another documented effect of mutual gaze may help explain why that
   moment of eye contact across a room can sometimes feel so compelling. A
   recent study found that mutual gaze leads to a kind of partial melding
   of the self and other: we rate strangers with whom we’ve made eye
   contact as more similar to us, in terms of their personality and
   appearance. Perhaps, in the right context, when everyone else is busy
   talking to other people, this effect adds to the sense that you and the
   person looking back at you are sharing a special moment.

   The chemistry of eye contact doesn’t end there. Should you choose to
   move closer, you and your gaze partner will find that eye contact also
   joins you to each other in another way, in a process known as “pupil
   mimicry” or “pupil contagion” – this describes how your pupils and the
   other person’s dilate and constrict in synchrony. This has been
   interpreted as a form of subconscious social mimicry, a kind of ocular
   dance, and that would be the more romantic take.

   But recently there’s been some scepticism about this, with researchers
   saying the phenomenon is merely a response to variations in the
   brightness of the other person’s eyes (up close, when the other
   person’s pupils dilate, this increases the darkness of the scene, thus
   causing your pupils to dilate too).
   When you look another person deep in the eye, do not think it is just
   their pupils sending you a message

   That is not to say that pupil dilation has no psychological meaning. In
   fact, going back at least to the 1960s, psychologists have studied the
   way that our pupils dilate when we are more aroused or stimulated (in a
   physiological sense), whether by intellectual, emotional, aesthetic or
   sexual interest. This has led to debate about whether faces with more
   dilated pupils (sometimes taken as a sign of sexual interest) are
   perceived by onlookers to be more attractive. At least some studies,
   some decades old and others more recent, suggest they are, and we also
   know that our brains automatically process the dilation of other
   people’s pupils.

   Either way, centuries prior to this research, folk wisdom certainly
   considered dilated pupils to be attractive. At various times in history
   women have even used a plant extract to deliberately dilate their
   pupils as a way to make themselves more attractive (hence the
   colloquial name for the plant: ‘belladonna’).

   But when you look another person deep in the eye, do not think it is
   just their pupils sending you a message. Other recent research suggests
   that we can read complex emotions from the eye muscles – that is,
   whether a person is narrowing or opening their eyes wide. So, for
   instance, when an emotion such as disgust causes us to narrow our eyes,
   this ‘eye expression’ – like a facial expression – also signals our
   disgust to others.

   Yet another important eye feature are limbal rings: the dark circles
   that surround your irises. Recent evidence suggests that these limbal
   rings are more often visible in younger, healthier people, and that
   onlookers know this on some level, such that heterosexual women looking
   for a short-term fling judge men with more visible limbal rings to be
   more healthy and desirable.

   All these studies suggest there is more than a grain of truth to the
   old adage about the eyes being a window to the soul. In fact, there is
   something incredibly powerful about gazing deeply into another person’s
   eyes. They say that our eyes are the only part of our brain that is
   directly exposed to the world.

   When you look another person in the eye, then, just think: it is
   perhaps the closest you will come to ‘touching brains’ – or touching
   souls if you like to be more poetic about these things. Given this
   intense intimacy, perhaps it is little wonder that if you dim the
   lights and hold the gaze of another person for 10 minutes non-stop, you
   will find strange things start to happen, stranger perhaps than you’ve
   ever experienced before.
