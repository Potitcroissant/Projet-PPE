    1. Who is this person looking at?

    2. Is he looking at you?

    3. What might this say about him and his identity?

   In portraits, the ‘gaze’ describes the way the artist and sitter look
   at each other, and the way we as viewers look at the person portrayed.

   In exploring the gaze, we analyse:
     * The sitter’s gaze: where the sitter is looking and what their
       expression is. Are they looking out at the artist and at us? Are
       they looking down or to the side or into the distance? Do they look
       confident or unsure?
     * The artist’s gaze: how did they see the sitter when making the
       portrait? How do they want us to see the sitter? How does this
       affect how they present the sitter?
     * Our own gaze as the (BUTTON) viewer Viewer The person looking at an
       artwork. (BUTTON) : how do we look at the person in the portrait?
       What information can we gain by looking at them? Do we interact
       with them, returning their gaze?

   Contemporary photographic portraits are often created through a
   dialogue between sitter and photographer. They decide between them how
   the sitter should appear in the photograph and how their identity
   should be reflected. This includes deciding on their gaze in the
   portrait and how the viewer sees or interacts with them.

     * (BUTTON) 1. Analyse Riz Ahmed’s gaze. Where is he looking and how
       does this affect how you look at and respond to the portrait?
          + Ahmed faces forward with his head at a slight angle. He gazes
            at the artist Sharif Hamza and the camera, and therefore at us
            the (BUTTON) viewer Viewer The person looking at an artwork.
            (BUTTON) .
          + His expression and steady gaze urge us to look back at him.
     * (BUTTON) 2. How has Sharif Hamza used the background, cropping of
       the photograph and camera angle to direct your gaze and how you
       interact with the portrait?
          + The plain background and close (BUTTON) cropping Cropping To
            cut off part of a photograph, picture or image. (BUTTON) of
            the photograph focuses our attention on Ahmed’s face,
            expression and gaze.
          + Hamza placed the camera directly in front of Ahmed, just below
            eye level. This gives the portrait a ‘no-nonsense’ quality,
            like a document or record.
          + We see Ahmed’s face clearly, despite the shadow. It seems as
            if he is looking straight at us, perhaps about to speak.
     * (BUTTON) 3. Who do you think holds the power in the portrait –
       Ahmed, Hamza or you as the viewer?
          + By focusing on Ahmed’s face and photographing him at just
            below eye level, Hamza has allowed Ahmed to own the gaze and
            take control of his image.
          + Ahmed chooses to look directly out at us, inviting us to
            return his gaze.
          + The relationship between Hamza and Ahmed appears
            collaborative. We are also invited in.
     * (BUTTON) 4. What is your impression of Ahmed’s identity from
       looking at the portrait?
          + Ahmed looks confident and at ease. He is an actor so is used
            to being in front of a camera.
          + He is also an (BUTTON) activist Activist A person who works to
            achieve political or social change, especially as a member of
            an organisation with particular aims. (BUTTON) who has raised
            awareness of the lack of diversity in film and television.
          + His direct, even challenging gaze can perhaps be interpreted
            as reflecting his mission to engage others in this important
            debate.

    1. What are your first impressions of each portrait?

    2. What do you think the sitter’s gaze tells us about them and their
       identity?

    3. How do the sitters’ pose and the composition of the portraits
       affect our gaze and how we interact with the sitters?

Look closer at Aida Overton Walker by Cavendish Morton

   Aida Overton Walker (1880–1914) was an actor, singer, dancer and
   choreographer. She was popular with audiences, respected by critics and
   financially successful. In this portrait, she is shown dressed in
   costume for a role she was playing.

   Although this photographic portrait was taken over one hundred years
   ago, in 1903, the image could almost have been taken yesterday. Aida
   Overton Walker seems to connect with us, looking back at us through the
   lens.

       How does this affect how you look at and engage with the portrait?

            position in which somebody stands or sits to have their
            portrait made. (BUTTON) sideways to the camera, but she looks

            position in which somebody stands or sits to have their
            portrait made. (BUTTON) suggests that she will be looking away
            from us and thus become the object of our gaze.
          + Her expression is difficult to read. It could be seen as
            confident, curious and defiant. But it might also be seen as
            if she is looking with caution or even fear.
          + Her unexpected gaze makes the portrait look less formal and
            more human, giving it a surprisingly contemporary feel. It
            seems as if she is challenging our expectations.
          + She wears a theatrical costume and her hair hangs loosely
            around her face. This adds to the informal look of the
            portrait.
          + This portrait was part of a series taken of the actors

     * (BUTTON) 2. Who do you think holds the power in the portrait –
       Overton Walker, the photographer, or you as the viewer?
          + Overton Walker takes control of the image by gazing sideways
            at the camera and at us – she appears to be giving us the
            ‘side-eye’.
          + She seems to disrupt the photographer’s plans as well as our
            expectations.
          + Being on the stage at that time was not always considered a
            respectable profession for women.
          + Many photographs of actresses and dancers from the early 1900s
            were made for viewers to gaze at, as if the (BUTTON) sitters

            person’s face or head and shoulders. (BUTTON) ’ photographs
            today. Perhaps this format adds to the contemporary look of
            the portrait.
     * (BUTTON) 4. What is your impression of Overton Walker’s identity
       from looking at the portrait? Does the portrait represent her or
       the character she is dressed as?
          + Overton Walker comes across as strong, confident and in
            control of how her identity is presented.
          + She was a respected and financially successful actor, and her
            accomplishment and sense of pride is reflected in the
            portrait.
          + The confidence shown in this portrait challenges racist ideas
            and imagery that were common when the photograph was taken,
            more than 100 years ago. At this time, Black Americans endured
            widespread discrimination. Although she is dressed in costume
            and photographed as the character she was playing, we have the
            sense that this portrait captures who she really was. In
            wearing the costume, perhaps she felt more liberated and able
            to express her true identity?

   helped (BUTTON) grime Grime A style of British rap music that started
   in the early 2000s in east London within young, multicultural
   communities. (BUTTON) become one of the largest British cultural,
   fashion and musical movements of the early 2000s. This contemporary
   Black British musical genre has enabled many to create a sense of
   belonging, and to connect to an audience beyond Britain. Stormzy is
   also an (BUTTON) activist Activist A person who works to achieve
   political or social change, especially as a member of an organisation

Olivia Rose

   Olivia Rose is a British director and photographer. She is interested
   in reflecting authenticity and character through her photographs,
   aiming to capture people at their ‘most human’.

The portrait

   This is one of a series of photographs of grime musicians Rose made for
   the book This is Grime. Before photographing the musicians, Olivia Rose
   spent time getting to know them and the grime scene more broadly. She
   did this so that she could put her (BUTTON) sitters The person in a
   portrait A person who sits or stands somewhere so that somebody can
   paint a picture of them or photograph them.  (BUTTON) at ease and get
   rid of any preconceptions she may have about them.

     I think it’s my shamelessness of being my silly human self ... that
     allows me to open twenty seconds of time when the subject is at
     their most human and jump in that moment to photograph them.

     * (BUTTON) 1. Analyse Stormzy’s pose and gaze. How does this affect
       how he comes across and how you respond to the portrait?
          + In this full-length portrait, Rose shows Stormzy sitting
            informally on a chair looking down at the ground.
          + He appears deep in thought and his gaze is one of (BUTTON)
            contemplation Contemplation The act of thinking deeply about
            something. (BUTTON) . This is not how we expect to see a
            successful musician posing in a photograph. It is as if we
            have caught him off-guard.
          + We perhaps feel a sense of trust and intimacy at being able to
            see Stormzy captured in this quiet moment.
          + Although Rose – with her camera – and we – as the (BUTTON)
            viewer Viewer The person looking at an artwork. (BUTTON) – are
            doing the looking, Stormzy seems comfortable with being looked
            at.
     * (BUTTON) 2. How has Olivia Rose used camera angle, composition and
       cropping to direct your gaze and your interaction with the
       portrait?
          + Rather than standing to take the photograph (and looking down
            at Stormzy), Rose placed the camera at the same height as him.
            This suggests that she was also sitting or crouching down.
          + We view the portrait as if we are at his seated height,
            perhaps sitting in front of or next to him.
          + Rose hasn’t placed Stormzy centrally in the composition but
            towards the bottom of the photograph with his foot touching
            the bottom edge. She has left space above his head, which
            emphasizes his seated (BUTTON) pose Pose A particular position
            in which somebody stands or sits to have their portrait made.
            (BUTTON) .
     * (BUTTON) 3. How does the background setting and Stormzy’s clothing
       affect how you read his identity?
          + Stormzy is casually dressed in an Adidas tracksuit, socks and
            sliders. These are ordinary everyday clothes that are popular
            among young people.
          + His clothes help us to see him as relatable rather than as a
            detached superstar.
          + The background also has an ordinary appearance. Stormzy sits
            in a run-down alley or backyard on a simple folding wooden
            chair. There is none of the luxury that we might associate
            with him.
          + This reflects Stormzy’s upbringing and identity. He grew up in
            a working-class family in south London.
          + The setting also reminds us of the urban, gritty nature of
            (BUTTON) grime Grime A style of British rap music that started
            in the early 2000s in east London within young, multicultural
            communities. (BUTTON) music.
          + The yard is behind his recording studio, reflecting his
            identity as a rapper and musician.
          + By choosing this setting for the portrait Rose and Stormzy
            suggest that despite his fame and success, he has stayed
            humble and close to his roots.
     * (BUTTON) 4. Who do you think holds the power in the portrait –
       Stormzy, the photographer or you the viewer?
          + At first, it seems that Olivia Rose with her camera and we as
            the (BUTTON) viewer Viewer The person looking at an artwork.
            (BUTTON) hold the power in the portrait – as we are doing the
            looking and Stormzy is being looked at.
          + But despite Stormzy’s contemplative, downward gaze, his
            (BUTTON) pose Pose A particular position in which somebody
            stands or sits to have their portrait made. (BUTTON) is
            confident and relaxed. With knees apart and arms resting on
            his knees, his body forms a strong rectangular shape that
            dominates the composition. The shape is emphasized by the
            geometric shapes of the architecture that surrounds him.
     * (BUTTON) 5. Olivia Rose has described her photographs of young men
       as ‘masculinity reinterpreted via [the] feminine gaze.’ Consider
       this statement. Does it change how you look at the portrait?
          + This portrait is not the type of portrait we expect to see of
            a successful man.
          + Stormzy does not gaze out of the portrait confidently,
            demanding attention and expecting praise.
          + As well as being a musician, Stormzy is an (BUTTON) activist
            Activist A person who works to achieve political or social
            change, especially as a member of an organisation with
            particular aims. (BUTTON) who speaks out against injustices.
            It is perhaps this thinking, caring side of Stormzy that Rose
            got to know and wanted to reflect in the portrait.

    1. What does the portrait suggest about the sitter’s identity and the
       relationship or dynamic between the sitter and the photographer?

Reflections

    1. Historically, artists and viewers were usually men. How do you
       think this might have affected how women appeared and were looked
       at in portraits?

    2. Try exploring the gaze in your own photographic portraits.
       Photograph a friend or family member looking at the camera and then
       photograph them looking away from the camera.
       How does this change the portrait and how you respond to the sitter
       and their identity?
