   Each week we bring you four of the most interesting objects from the
   world’s museums, galleries and art institutions, hand-picked to mark
   significant moments in the calendar.

   On 11 October 1965, Dorothea Lange, the documentary photographer who
   captured the suffering and resilience of Americans during the Great
   Depression, died at the age of 70. Lange’s legacy extends far beyond
   individual images: she questioned who holds the power to look and who
   gets looked at, making clearer than ever that photography is capable of
   both empowerment and exploitation. Her work raised questions about
   photographers’ responsibility and subjects’ agency that are still
   debated today.

   The concept of ‘the gaze’ has become central to contemporary art
   criticism, and denotes far more than the act of observation. It
   concerns power dynamics between viewer and viewed, the politics of
   representation and the complex relationship between artist, subject and
   audience. From Orientalist fantasies that reduce cultures to ‘exotic’
   spectacle, to subversive works that challenge long-held perspectives,
   art has long made us consider the ethical implications of looking. This
   week we examine four works that illuminate different aspects of the
   gaze, each revealing how the act of seeing is never neutral but always
   charged with desire and power.

   Musée des Beaux-Arts Jules Chéret, Nice

   Ziem’s sensuous depiction of a dancing almeh is a textbook example of
   Orientalist fantasy. The painter offers a stolen glimpse into a world
   usually hidden from men, as well as the architectural splendour of
   Constantinople. This romanticised vision obscures reality: almehs were
   in reality sophisticated entertainers, healers and teachers, respected
   for their intellectual as well as physical abilities. Ziem’s painting
   reveals more about European fantasies of ‘the East’ than about its
   actual inhabitants, demonstrating how certain gazes can reduce complex
   cultures to consumable spectacle. Click here to find out more via

   Portrait (Futago) (1988), Yasumasa Morimura
   Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh

   Morimura’s provocative recreation of Manet’s Olympia creates a hall of
   mirrors that challenges our assumptions about artistic authority and
   cultural ownership. By inserting his own body into this canonical
   Western masterpiece – itself influenced by the flat perspective of
   Japanese ukiyo-e – the artist exposes the circular nature of cultural
   appropriation while subverting the gender and racial hierarchies
   embedded in Manet’s painting. The work forces viewers to confront their
   own expectations and biases, making the artwork’s primary subject the
   act of looking itself. Click here to find out more.

   Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

   As one of only three women in the Impressionists’ inner circle along
   with Berthe Morisot and Marie Bracquemond, Cassatt brought an unusual
   perspective to the group’s favoured subject of spectatorship. Here she
   presents a woman who actively participates in the ‘game of gazes’
   rather than serving as passive spectacle. The foregrounded figure looks
   on with confident directness while a male observer lurks in the
   background, his gaze registering as secondary to hers. Cassatt’s bold
   composition is an elegant example of how women artists could subtly
   challenge patriarchal conventions of looking. Click here to discover

   Patient Admission, US Naval Hospital Ship Mercy, Vietnam (2010), from
   the Events Ashore series (2005–14) by An-My Lê
   Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane

   Lê’s photograph captures a moment of cultural encounter aboard the USS
   Mercy, where a Buddhist monk and a US naval officer sit on either side
   of a steel column that seems to represent the barrier between their
   worlds. Both subjects appear acutely conscious of the camera’s
   presence, which lends the image its tension. The artist’s Vietnamese
   heritage adds nuance to this scene of American military presence in
   Southeast Asia, creating a work that makes us consider how cultural
   difference might be represented without reproducing certain power
   dynamics. Click here to learn more.
