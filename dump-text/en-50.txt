THE FEMALE GAZE IN ART: REDEFINING PERSPECTIVES AND NARRATIVES

THE FEMALE GAZE IN ART: REDEFINING PERSPECTIVES AND NARRATIVES

   Has there ever been a Female Gaze in art history? What is the Female
   Gaze — a narrative crafted by women for women? How might our
   perspective differ if John Berger had not observed the concept of
   ‘looking’ in the 1970s?

   Let us dig deeper into the (hi)story of Art, and reckon our
   understanding of Western Art History, particularly through the lens of
   Female-representation since the 19th century.

   The representation of women came under scrutiny during the intellectual
   revolution influenced by feminism. In European art after the
   Renaissance, a recurring theme emerged — the depiction of the nude
   form. The representation of the male nude in art has often been
   associated with monumentality — placed on pedestals that were larger
   than life — while the depiction of the female body followed a markedly
   different path.

   In the 1970s, art critic John Berger delved into the concept of
   “looking,” leading to a deeper exploration of gaze and representation
   in art. His seminal BBC series “Ways of Seeing” (1972) examined
   centuries of visual culture, revealing a consistent theme — painting
   women through the eyes of male artists. He questioned the impact of
   female representation through the male gaze in shaping their historical
   and social contexts.

   From this insight came the concept of the male gaze in feminist theory,
   which perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces gender inequality in art.
   Berger’s work highlighted the need to rethink artistic symbolism and
   critique the dominant narrative alongside feminist discourse, paving
   the way for critical consideration of gender, power, and identity in
   art.

   19th Century Depictions of Women

   In the 19th century, visual media often depicted women as objects of
   beauty and symbols of domestic life. These images reinforced
   traditional gender roles and patriarchal structures. Paintings like
   Sandro Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus” and John William Waterhouse’s “A
   Mermaid” illustrated this refined image of women, portraying them as
   ethereal and idealised figures within social and cultural contexts.

   However, as the 20th century progressed, art images began to change
   dramatically. Influenced by feminist movements and changing social
   attitudes, artists began to challenge earlier conservative depictions.
   Women were now portrayed in complexity, freedom, and diversity, marking
   a broader cultural shift. This shift allowed for exploring the nuances
   of women’s identities beyond mere aesthetics, contributing to an
   inclusive and intense image in visual culture.

   A key moment in this development was Edouard Manet’s “Olympia,” which
   caused a scandal in the 1860s for its daring depiction of a female
   nude. Unlike Sandro Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus,” John Mailer
   Collier’s “Lady Godiva,” John William Waterhouse’s “A Mermaid,” and
   Jean-Léon Gerome’s “Venus Rising”, Manet’s Olympia challenged
   conventions by presenting a realistic contemporary view of women. This
   bold departure from artistic norms reflected the challenges of modern
   life, portraying the female subject not as a fixed object of desire but
   as a confident individual.

   Evolution in the 20th Century

   As the 20th century progressed, depictions of women in art evolved
   dramatically, and feminist movements inspired widespread social change.
   Artists like Frida Kahlo and Georgia O’Keeffe created unprecedentedly
   complex portraits of women, exploring issues of identity, sexuality,
   and agency through art, presenting women as empowered, independent
   individuals.

   The rise of women’s art parallels the broader struggle for women’s
   rights, inspiring female artists to respond with bold, defiant themes
   that celebrate gender pride and confront social inequality. This
   artistic revolution was an active representation of women’s experiences
   and expressions. During the Mexican cultural revolution of the 1920s,
   artists like Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros emerged as
   pioneers of public art, reinforcing revolutionary ideals and mestizo
   identity.

   The importance of conversation in women’s art cannot be overstated.
   Suzanne Lacey, Frida Kahlo, Georgia O’Keeffe, and others did
   provocative work that confronted social taboos and gender stereotypes.
   Their art was not just personal expression but a means of social
   change, challenging audiences to confront uncomfortable truths and
   rethink traditional ideas.

   The 20th-century feminist art movement reshaped representations of
   women and expanded the boundaries of public discourse. By criticising
   social norms and praising all identities, women artists turned art into
   a powerful tool for critique and empowerment. Their contributions
   continue to resonate, inspiring future generations to explore new
   boundaries of creativity and activism in the ongoing pursuit of gender
   equality.

   Challenges and Contributions

   Throughout history, women artists have faced discrimination in the art
   world. Despite challenges, they have made significant contributions,
   challenging stereotypes and reshaping perceptions. The Guerrilla Girls,
   a collective of feminist artists, have been key advocates for gender
   equality in art, sparking important conversations about inclusion and
   representation.

   Historically, female artistic figures were often idolised for their
   physical attributes, as exemplified by iconic Renaissance paintings.
   These images established social concepts of femininity and reinforced
   their objectification. Among these, Georgia O’Keeffe emerged as a
   pioneer of American modernism, breaking down barriers with a
   distinctive female perspective.

   The resurgence of feminism in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in art
   history, sparking the feminist movement. Pioneered by artists like
   Cindy Sherman and Hannah Wilke, each sought unique ways to challenge
   and redefine representations of women in art. These artists broke
   traditional boundaries, supporting and amplifying women’s voices in
   contemporary art. Their legacy inspires and empowers artists and
   audiences, emphasising gendered journeys and equality in art and
   society.

   In conclusion, the evolution of women’s representation in art reflects
   broader societal changes and challenges. From the idealised figures of
   the Renaissance to the bold subjects of contemporary feminist art,
   women artists have continuously pushed boundaries and reshaped cultural
   narratives. John Berger’s foundation on the politics of visual
   representation still resonates with contemporary discourse. By
   critiquing the male gaze and advocating for a more inclusive art world,
   Berger laid the groundwork for an ongoing conversation about gender,
   power, and identity in art. The agency of female representation has
   been boldly taken over by female practitioners of our current times, as
   art in the 21st century moves towards an expression and claiming of
   female sexuality.
