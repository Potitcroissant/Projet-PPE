   Eye movement and lying: Genuine or junk science?

   By Autumn Sprabary

   Don Henley once sang, “There ain’t no way to hide your lyin’ eyes.”

   For years, communication experts believed that a person’s eye behavior
   could tell whether they were lying. This idea has been the premise for
   many movies and TV shows, which took the idea of “lying eyes” and made
   it mainstream.

   Since then, the validity of eye direction and lying has been called
   into question. After studying the behaviors of honesty and deceit,
   researchers believe that our understanding of lying eyes may be a lie
   in itself.

Eye direction and lying theory

   Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) spawned the theory that eye
   direction is related to telling lies vs. the truth. NLP is a system
   developed in 1975 by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The focus of NLP
   was to understand how people’s personal experiences shape how they
   process information.

   The study of NLP inspired Bandler and Grinder to study eye positions
   and information processing.

   They claimed that a person who was pulling information from a memory
   would look toward the top right corner of their visual field. This is
   known as visual recall .

   Someone who’s constructing an idea not from memory would look toward
   the top left corner of their visual field. This is known as visual
   construct .

   Bandler and Grinder further hypothesized that when a person recalls a
   sound, they would look laterally toward the right. This reaction is
   known as verbal recall . If they were imagining a new sound, such as a
   dog singing opera, they would look to the left. This reaction is called
   verbal construct .

   According to NLP, eye behaviors could label just about every aspect of
   memory recall. Remembering how something feels (kinesthetic), or
   processing inner dialogue (auditory digital) are also included.

   The “right side” or “left side” is relative to the observer’s point of
   view. The meaning behind each eye direction is reflective of a person
   who is right handed. The rules would be the opposite for a left-handed
   person.

   Once these hypotheses were published, the public believed them and
   spread the information. However, the accuracy of the statements weren’t
   properly tested.

The truth behind eye movement and lying

   Three studies tested the reliability of Bandler and Grinder’s claim
   about eye movement and truthfulness.

   In the first study, right-handed participants were filmed both while
   lying and telling the truth. Participants were aware that the study was
   related to lying, but were not told that their eye movements would be
   tracked.

   While answering a series of questions, researchers tracked the number
   of times a participant looked up and to the right, or up and to the
   left. These movements were coded and compared to what NLP experts
   hypothesized.

   Study results did not support the hypotheses that upper right gaze
   indicates lying. Nor that looking up and to the left indicates
   truthfulness.

   In the second experiment, 50 participants were split into two equal
   groups. They were asked to watch the interviews recorded in the first
   study. One group of participants was told about the NLP eye movement
   theory and the other was not.

   All participants marked whether they believed the subjects in the
   videos were lying or telling the truth. They also indicated how
   confident they were in their observation. Results showed no difference
   between the accuracy or confidence of the two groups in their
   assessment of the videos. These results provide no proof for NLP lie
   detection claims.

   In the final experiment, two independent raters watched videos of known
   liars and truth tellers. Of all the videos viewed by the raters, there
   were no instances of upper left or upper right gazes.

   None of these studies provide any evidence that the NLP theory of eye
   movement and lie detection are reliable or accurate.

Nonverbal cues and lying

   If you’re looking for surefire cues to rely on for pinpointing a liar,
   you’ll likely end up disappointed. The more research that’s done on the
   art of lying, the more experts realize that spotting a liar is tough,
   and humans are particularly bad at finding them.

   Scientific studies have been done to test how well police officers are
   able to detect a truth versus a lie. Results found that the accuracy of
   detecting when someone was being truthful was 67%. Detecting a lie had
   an accuracy rate of only 44% — that’s less than chance.

   Methods for gauging deceit haven’t improved over the years. The U.S.
   Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses a checklist to weed
   out suspicious travelers going through airport security.

   The behaviors on this checklist include:
     * Whistling
     * Averted gaze (avoiding eye contact)
     * Excessive fidgeting or personal grooming
     * Prolonged stare
     * Rapid blinking
     * Exaggerated yawning
     * Complaining

   Though TSA relies on these cues, they are not reliable and have been
   debunked by researchers. Because what’s suspicious behavior to one
   person may be normal behavior to another.

   For example, avoiding eye contact is considered a sign of respect in
   some cultures. So, while a TSA agent may view this behavior as
   suspicious, it’s usually a cultural misunderstanding.

   Approximately 3,700 complaints were filed against TSA within a two-year
   and four-month period. The complaints alleged civil rights and civil
   liberties violations related to passenger screenings. This further
   proves that nonverbal cues are not a reliable or accurate indicator of
   lying.

Verbal clues and lying

   Nonverbal cues may not be a good way to spot a liar, but not all hope
   is lost. Some verbal cues have proved to be more accurate for sniffing
   out lies, but they’re still not ironclad evidence.

   One hypothesis about verbal cues and lying is called the cognitive
   hypothesis . It explains that the act of lying requires more brain
   power than telling the truth. As a result, the liar’s behavior will be
   affected.

   This includes speech disturbances (lots of ums and uhs) caused by the
   cognitive complexity of fabricating a lie. The more complex the lie,
   the more the liar will hesitate or experience speech disturbances.

   Another hypothesis is called the attempted control hypothesis . This
   hypothesis says that a liar may be aware of the stereotypes or “signs”
   of deceit. Because of this, they manage their speech, body language and
   behavior to avoid suspicion.

   Other verbal clues that may tip the scale toward falsehood include how
   the person recalls certain events. Studies show that truth tellers
   usually have a “tell them everything” strategy. Liars use a “keep it
   simple” strategy, and provide very few details. They may also avoid
   including themselves in the narrative.

How to tell if someone is lying

   When given the direct question of “is this person lying?” it can be
   more difficult to trust your gut. However, analyzing details about a
   person’s behavior can make your instinct a reliable source for lie
   detection.

   Dr. Bella DePaulo conducted a study in which participants were exposed
   to various liars and truth tellers. The exposure included watching
   videos, listening to audio clips, reading transcripts and face-to-face.

   Participants were instructed to discern whether they thought the person
   was lying or telling the truth. They were also asked non-direct
   questions such as:
     * How comfortable or uncomfortable did the person seem?
     * How comfortable or suspicious did you feel with this person?

   In nearly all instances of questioning, participants distinguished lies
   from truths better when relying on their answers to the non-direct
   questions.

   So, if you’re trying to determine whether someone is lying to you,
   relying on your intuition may be your best bet. Ask yourself smaller,
   less direct questions about the encounter instead of the one big
   question at hand.

   Analyzing different details of the suspect, as well as how you felt
   during the exchange, may help you uncover the truth you’re looking for.
