   On October 1 1975, the academic journal Screen published an essay by
   British film theorist Laura Mulvey titled Visual Pleasure and Narrative
   Cinema.

   It is a groundbreaking critique of classical Hollywood cinema, which
   Mulvey argues is constructed around patriarchal ideologies that shape
   how women are represented onscreen.

   This foundational text transformed how scholars, film critics and
   audiences think about the relationship between gender and onscreen
   representation.

A critique of Hollywood

   Mulvey came to prominence in the 1970s, a time when second-wave
   feminism was reshaping academic and cultural debates.

   She made films, often with her partner Peter Wollen. These included the
   experimental feminist works Riddles of the Sphinx (1977) and
   Penthesilea (1974).

   The radical counter-cinema ideas expressed in her film works would make
   their way into her 1975 essay.

   First, Mulvey grapples with Hollywood’s sexual politics, and the stark
   imbalances of power between men and women.

   She suggests film adopts the viewpoint of a heterosexual male
   spectator: the camera lingers on women’s bodies, framing them for
   erotic appeal, while men typically drive the action and control the
   narrative:

     The magic of the Hollywood style at its best […] arose, not
     exclusively, but in one important aspect, from its skilled and
     satisfying manipulation of visual pleasure. Unchallenged, mainstream
     film coded the erotic into the language of the dominant patriarchal
     order.

   Mulvey says this “visual pleasure” is baked into the framework of
   Hollywood cinema. The way shots are composed, the way the camera moves,
   and the way scenes are edited all reinforce patriarchal power
   structures and objectify women.

How the ‘male gaze’ works

   A central tenet of the essay is the concept of the “male gaze”. This
   term has become central to feminist debates, not just in film studies,
   but also in media studies, art theory and advertising.

   Drawing on the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques
   Lacan, Mulvey argues mainstream cinema positions women as passive
   objects of male desire.

   Famously, she notes the:

     male gaze projects its phantasy onto the female figure, which is
     styled accordingly […] Women are simultaneously looked at and
     displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic
     impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness.

   This male gaze is comprised of three interconnected “looks”:
    1. the look of the camera: how the film is shot (the framing, camera
       movement, editing and so forth)
    2. the look of the characters: how male characters gaze at female
       characters
    3. the look of the audience: how spectators are positioned to adopt a
       masculine viewpoint.

   When the camera eroticises a woman, when male characters watch her, and
   when the audience shares this view, the male gaze is at its most
   powerful.

   Mulvey frequently uses psychoanalytic terms like “scopophilia” (the
   pleasure of watching) and “voyeurism” (secretly watching for pleasure)
   to explain how Hollywood cinema reinforces unconscious desires and
   power structures.

   Her examples come from 1940s and 1950s Hollywood, and especially the
   films of Alfred Hitchcock. She notes how, in Rear Window (1954), James
   Stewart’s photographer character spends much of the film secretly
   looking through his camera lens into other people’s apartments.

   In Vertigo (1958), James Stewart (this time playing a detective)
   voyeuristically stalks Kim Novak’s Madeleine. He follows, watches and
   falls in love with a perfect image of female mystery and beauty.
   Hitchcock’s shot selection makes the viewer complicit in his voyeurism.

   We can see the male gaze in slow-motion or lingering shots that focus
   on sexualised aspects of women’s bodies, in lighting and costumes
   designed to emphasise the erotic, or in narratives that halt for a
   moment of female display, before the main plot resumes.

   Cameron Diaz’s first appearance in The Mask (1994) is a clear example
   of the male gaze in full operation.

Critiques of Mulvey’s argument

   Various scholars have challenged Mulvey’s text. Feminist scholar
   Camille Paglia called Mulvey’s argument “simplistic”, saying:

     The idea that a man looking at or a director filming a beautiful
     woman makes her an object, makes her passive beneath the male gaze
     […] I think this was utter nonsense from the start. […] It was an a
     priori theory: first there was feminist ideology, asserting that
     history is nothing but male oppression and female victimization, and
     then came this theory — the “victim” model of feminism applied
     wholesale to works of culture.

   Others argue Mulvey failed to take into account spectator diversity, as
   not all viewers are heterosexual men.

   In 1992, American theorist bell hooks coined the term “oppositional
   gaze” to offer a counterpoint to the sexualized, gendered gaze proposed
   by Mulvey that took into account racial power dynamics.

   Mulvey herself has acknowledged these critiques. In her 1990 essay
   Afterthoughts on Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, she revisits her
   arguments to account for more fluid and diverse spectatorship.

Mulvey’s legacy

   Mulvey’s concepts from the 1970s can still be applied to contemporary
   films. The male gaze continues to manifest in filmmaking patterns
   designed to align spectators with male characters.

   The James Bond franchise has long presented women characters as
   eroticised objects that exist merely for the hero’s pleasure. And the
   critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049 (2017) was criticised for
   treating female characters as sex objects.

   Terms such as “female gaze” and “queer gaze” have become increasingly
   common on social media and in film analysis.

   Mulvey’s essay reflected a specific moment in 1970s feminist thought.
   She recently said, at the time, she thought it would eventually become
   “an archaeological object of theoretical and historical interest”.

   Yet, 50 years on, her identification of the basic dynamics of Hollywood
   continues to shape much of our understanding of visual media.
