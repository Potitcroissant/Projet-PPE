   Amount of time spent on maintaining eye contact is a matter of culture
   and an individual decision. The less you look your client in their
   eyes, the more your client has to guess. They have to guess what does
   the seller mean, both in terms of positives (it increases their
   creativity and curiosity) and in terms of negatives (it raises
   suspicions that the seller might be embarrassed or that he is lying).
   When eye contact lasts longer, both parties have a greater feeling of
   control and communication becomes more intensive in terms of emotions
   and quantity. The general principle is to maintain eye contact with
   your client for about 40-70% of the time of your conversation,
   adjusting intensity depending on your interlocutor.

   When trader’s eye contact is poor, his client might come to wrong
   conclusions, e.g. they might think that the trader is looking up
   because he wants to hide the truth, while looking down may be perceived
   as a sign of lack of self-confidence. When eye contact is too
   intensive, your interlocutor may feel intimidated or provoked. In case
   of female-male relationship it might be interpreted sexually.

You can use three basic types of gazes:

   1. The professional gaze – you look at your client’s forehead and in
   their eyes. It’s a good idea to raise your head a little, which will
   create a professional distance. If you lean back and speak in a lower,
   clear voice you will be taken more seriously. This type of gaze makes
   it difficult to build an amiable relationship, but it emphasizes
   seller’s competencies.

   2. The sociable gaze – you follow your client’s face with your eyes.
   This technique makes it easier to establish a relationship. When using
   this technique, it’s important to remember where to focus your gaze.
   Proper proportions are 70% concentration on eyes, 30% on lips.
   Inverting those proportions may be interpreted as an invitation to more
   intimacy – this is what we subconsciously do when we find a potential
   partner to be attractive, this behavior is a part of the seduction
   ritual. This type of gaze, when applied properly, allows you to move
   from being perceived as an expert to being perceived as someone closer,
   who’s ready to build a closer relationship. You can use this type of
   gaze right from the beginning or after you’ve already built your image
   of an expert.

   3. The intimate gaze – you look at your client’s whole body. This
   technique allows you to speed up the process of building a
   relationship. For example, if you are meeting with someone who is well
   dressed or attracts your attention with a particular accessory item,
   it’s a perfect opportunity to utilize this type of gaze. You look at
   their whole figure and, for example, say: “Oh, these are very nice
   shoes! Where did you buy them?”. It allows you to immediately establish
   a better, more intimate relationship. However, you should remember that
   this kind of approach has to be sincere and spontaneous (you have to
   really like those shoes, your reaction cannot give the impression that
   it was calculated), otherwise it will make your client suspect that you
   are trying to manipulate them. Those behaviors send a signal of greater
   closeness to your client’s brain and create an opportunity to build
   your relationship more intensively.

   Remember that your client’s gaze conveys certain information too.
   Observe where and when they fixate their eyes – if they happen to look
   at the contract, it’s a signal informing that they might be interested
   in reading its terms. Concentrated gaze of your client and their
   dilated pupils indicate a likelihood of enthusiasm. Always carefully
   observe your client’s gaze, it’s a window to a lot of invaluable
   information.
