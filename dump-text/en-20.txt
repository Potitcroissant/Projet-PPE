Abstract

   Michel Foucault developed the concept of ‘the medical gaze’, describing
   how doctors fit a patient’s story into a ‘biomedical paradigm,
   filtering out what is deemed as irrelevant material’ (Misselbrook,
   2013). Doctors are perceived within this model to focus on selecting
   the biomedical elements of patients’ problems only, filtering out all
   other elements of a person’s life story, but this paper argues that in
   the subspecialty of psychiatry, this is not the case, and such a filter
   is not so easily applied.

   Keywords: Foucault, Medical anthropology, Psychiatry

Introduction

   What is the medical gaze? Michel Foucault developed the concept of ‘the
   medical gaze’, describing how doctors fit a patient’s story into a
   ‘biomedical paradigm, filtering out what is deemed as irrelevant
   material’ [1]. Doctors are perceived within this model to focus on
   selecting the biomedical elements of patients’ problems, but this paper
   argues that in the subspecialty of psychiatry, this is not the case,
   and such a filter is not so easily applied. Psychiatrists hold a unique
   position in the field of medicine, with more emphasis on subjective
   individual experience.

   The American Psychiatric Association defines Psychiatry as ‘the branch
   of medicine focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
   mental, emotional and behavioural disorders’ [2], and the psychiatrist
   as ‘a medical doctor who specialises in mental health, qualified to
   assess both the mental and physical aspects of psychological problems’.
   This appears at first glance as a role which should fit well into the
   needs of a modern society. From where then did this subspecialty spawn
   such staunch opposition, with anti-psychiatry movements questioning
   both the legitimacy of the specialty, and the validity of their
   definitions and roles? There is an increased awareness of the gap
   between diagnostic definitions and the lived personal experience of
   wellness or illness. The WHO defines health as ‘A state of complete
   physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of
   disease or infirmity’ [3]. Is this definition of health the focus of
   the modern psychiatrist; or is the focus instead on the absence of
   illness as defined within narrow diagnostic criteria?

Power within social systems

   Michel Foucault (1926–1984) was a French historian and philosopher who
   had a strong influence in both philosophy and a wide range of
   humanistic and social science disciplines. His work Madness and
   Civilisation: A history of insanity in the age of reason explored his
   view of ‘the moral hypocrisy of modern psychiatry’ [4]. He argued that
   what was presented as ‘an objective, incontrovertible scientific
   discovery (that madness is mental illness) was in fact the product of
   eminently questionable social and ethical commitments’ [4]. This may
   have had some truth in an Irish 1960’s asylum system, which was often
   used not as a centre for treatment but as a forum for social control,
   when one in every fifty citizens of the Republic of Ireland was a
   resident in a psychiatric institution [5]. But is this still the case
   in a modern, if underfunded, psychiatry system, with individualised
   care plans and a focus on outpatient treatment in the community?
   Following the introduction of antipsychotic medications and formalised
   treatment pathways for previously untreatable diagnoses, Ireland has
   moved to a system that is no longer reliant on a long-term asylum
   system.

   Foucault was particularly interested in the exercise of power within
   social systems, and he explored perceived relationships between
   knowledge and power within medicine in his work The Birth of the
   Clinic. Foucault argued that those in power set the agenda. This is a
   concept which remains palpable in today’s medical systems in the
   context of involuntary detention under the Mental Health Act. This
   power exists only in the initial period of a patients’ illness, and the
   current system focusses on empowering people once they retain capacity
   through adequate treatment, a situation only made possible by that
   initial therapeutic power dynamic. This power does not go unchecked,
   and the Irish Mental Health Act reflects patients’ rights and
   adequately allows opportunity for neutral observers to ensure this
   power is being appropriately used via second opinions and tribunal
   reviews.

   Treatment ideologies and professional approaches within clinical
   medicine have changed over the years. Nicholas Jewson described the
   production of medical knowledge as rooted in society, and not within a
   purely objective science [6]. He described the move from
   person-orientated to object-orientated to laboratory medicine, which he
   described in his work The disappearance of the sick-man from medical
   cosmology, 1770–1870 [8]. This corresponds with the emergence of
   Foucault’s described clinical gaze, which no longer views the patient
   as a whole but instead as a series of disconnected parts.

Medical systems and socio-cultural contexts

   Arthur Kleinman, a psychiatrist and anthropologist, stated that
   ‘medicine deals with two kinds of reality, “scientific” and “ordinary”;
   both a biophysical and human science’ [7]. Medical systems do exist in
   socio-cultural contexts, and ‘the experience of illness is a cultural
   or symbolic reality’ [7]. Kleinman argued that the narrow traditional
   medical gaze exists in a system which is ‘an ordered, coherent body of
   ideas, values, and practices embedded in a given cultural context from
   which it derives its signification’ [7]. While there is an assumption
   of power on the behalf of the clinician, ‘the acts of ordering, naming,
   interpreting, and offering therapy for illness are aspects of symbolic
   reality common to both the sick individual, the healer, and their
   society’ [7]. What then is the role of classificatory systems? In
   psychiatry practice, there is a reliance on the World Health
   Organisation’s ICD-10 criteria, or the American DSM criteria when
   applying diagnostic classifications. Having an overarching conceptual
   understanding of the individuals’ experience helps to guide treatment
   and provide prognostic clarity that can be comforting and empowering to
   both patients and their families. This supports the use of diagnostic
   classification systems despite their flaws and in some cases lack of
   pure objectivity.

   In psychiatry, it is clear that ‘the experience of illness involves
   feelings, ideas, values, language and non-verbal communication’ [7],
   all of which are included in a thorough mental state examination.
   Kleinman argued that there are ‘systematic attempts to restrict
   medicine’s symbolic reality to a single discipline, psychiatry,
   peripheral to the central core of medical research interests and
   practices’ [7]. Kleinmann recognised that psychiatry retains the wider
   biopsychosocial gaze that is missing in Foucault’s medical gaze,
   despite its narrow diagnostic classificatory systems.

Patient narratives of illness

   The medical model and its use in the medical gaze ties in with
   rationalism, black-and-white thinking and beliefs within Western
   medicine. Byron J. Good, a medical anthropologist, defined the primary
   role of clinical medicine as ‘the interpretation of the patient’s
   symptoms by relating them to their functional and structural sources in
   the body and to underlying disease entities’ [7]. However, he also
   notes that ‘all medicine joins rational and deeply irrational elements,
   combining an attention to the material body with a concern for the
   moral dimensions of sickness and suffering’ [7]. Subjectivity exists
   for both patient and clinician and inter-rater reliability may not be
   consistent, and psychiatrists called to provide expert opinion do not
   always agree in their assessments.

   Diagnostic definitions lose their importance if the focus can instead
   be on individualised treatment of the suffering and distress of each
   individual, using overarching diagnostic definitions in order to guide
   these treatments. Good speaks of symptoms as ‘expressions of the
   experience of distress, communicated as an ordered set of complaints’,
   but how can this order be ensured? In psychiatry, an understanding of
   language and culture is integral to definitions of diagnoses
   themselves. A delusion is defined as ‘a false, unshakeable idea or
   belief which is out of keeping with the patient’s educational, cultural
   and social background’ [8]. This is increasingly important in an Irish
   society which is becoming more diverse.

Conclusion

   Foucault’s concept of the medical gaze is not relevant to the modern
   psychiatric clinician. The power he speaks of exists only in the
   initial period of a patients’ illnesses as a treatment tool. While the
   medical gaze ties clinicians to the use of narrow diagnostic criteria
   in the treatment of patients, focus should instead be on individualised
   treatment of the suffering and distress of every individual. It is both
   increasingly important and difficult for psychiatry services to retain
   this open perspective to treatment of suffering and distress in a
   setting where there is increasing pressure secondary to underfunding
   and increased presentations. Clinicians should continue to focus on
   helping rather than controlling patients, particularly within a
   specialty with such direct exposure to the human suffering resulting
   from trauma, control and societal pressures.
