What Is the Male Gaze? Criticisms of the Male Gaze in Media

   Written by MasterClass

   Last updated: Sep 26, 2022 • 3 min read

   The male gaze places women in the context of male desire, essentially
   portraying the female body as eye candy for the heterosexual man. By
   valuing the desires of the male audience, the male gaze supports the
   self-objectification of women.

What Is the Male Gaze?

   According to feminist theory, the male gaze is a sexualized way of
   portraying women. By objectifying women, the male gaze represents women
   through the sexual desires of heterosexual male viewers. It depicts the
   female body and personality as an object for men to view, own, and
   conquer.

   This objectification of women has been prevalent in literature, cinema,
   and the visual arts throughout history. For example, in cinema, the
   camera often uses close-up shots to highlight female actresses’ bodies
   and sexualized appearances. This style of filming places the desires
   and thoughts of the female character as secondary to those of the male
   characters.

A Brief Overview of the History of the Male Gaze

   The objectification of women has occurred for centuries, although
   people have begun to discuss the concept of the male gaze only
   relatively recently. Here is a quick look at the history of the male
   gaze:
     * Coining the term: The term male gaze dates back to the 1972
       docuseries Ways of Seeing. In this television series, art critic
       John Berger focused on analyzing Western European art, countering
       the traditional way of viewing and depicting the female body.
       Berger argued there had been a long cultural and artistic history
       of portraying women as passive objects to please men.
     * Furthering the concept: Following Berger’s work, feminist and
       filmmaker Laura Mulvey used the term “male gaze” in her 1975 essay,
       “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” Mulvey used a
       psychoanalytical lens to analyze the treatment and portrayal of
       women in Hollywood, exposing the narrative of misogyny. Mulvey
       argued mainstream films focused on pleasing the male scopophilia
       (the sexual pleasure of looking).
     * Lasting impact: Mulvey’s essay continues to influence media studies
       and the way film theorists examine and produce cinematic work as
       filmmakers move away from the male gaze and support more positive
       ideologies.

Criticism of the Male Gaze

   The male gaze has a negative impact on women since it conditions women
   to adhere to a patriarchal conception of how a woman should look and
   act. It influences how women view themselves, as it emphasizes physical
   appearance, which can negatively impact their mental health, lowering
   their levels of self-esteem. By placing women in subservient roles to
   please the male spectator, female empowerment is secondary to male
   sexual desires and the patriarchy.

   When advertisements, TV shows, movies, and artwork depict women as
   sexual objects, young girls accept this point of view as the norm. Body
   shame is another side effect of the male gaze, as women compare
   themselves to these sexualized images of female characters in the
   media. The male gaze constricts how women define themselves,
   diminishing their potential purposes outside of a sexualized and
   objectified context.

How to Combat the Male Gaze

   By understanding the impact of the male gaze, you can help generate
   awareness and initiate important conversations relevant to feminism.
   Here are three steps you can take as you start to combat the male gaze:
     * Apply a critical lens. Understanding how to identify the male gaze
       can help you think critically about different forms of visual
       media. Spot the types of stereotypes and negative images certain
       people associate with the male gaze so you can help eliminate the
       harmful narrative.
     * Place women in roles of empowerment. Counter the male gaze by
       placing women in roles of empowerment and authority. By removing
       the tropes associated with the male gaze and changing the images
       certain people associate with the female character, young girls can
       view themselves in productive and successful roles.
     * Spread awareness. Engaging in productive conversations is a great
       starting point for combating the male gaze. By discussing the male
       gaze and its negative effects, you can help spread awareness and
       change the narrative.
