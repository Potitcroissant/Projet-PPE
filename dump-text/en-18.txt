Beyond the medical gaze: Practicing Psychologically Informed Healthcare

   Dr Liza Morton calls for a little ‘R.E.S.P.E.C.T’…

   I've depended on cutting-edge cardiology care since birth, in the late
   70s. My care was survival-focused, with little attention given to the
   psychological and emotional impacts. As a teenager, I searched in vain
   for books on the psychological impact of growing up with a serious
   health condition; a gap that motivated my eventual career as a
   psychologist, researcher, advocate and author.

   Chronic health condition (CHCs) affect approximately one-third of the
   global population (WHO, 2023) and can impact on daily functioning,
   relationships, self-esteem, parenting and life choices, increasing
   vulnerability to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.
   Healthcare professionals also face occupational challenges to their
   wellbeing which can result in burnout, compassion fatigue and vicarious
   trauma, negatively impacting on patient care. Yet, current healthcare
   policy and practice poorly addresses psychological and emotional
   wellbeing, for patients or practitioners.

   This 'medical gaze' is a false economy which not only leads to distress
   but contributes to poor medical adherence, missed appointments,
   maladaptive coping strategies (e.g. alcohol abuse, smoking, risk
   taking), medical error and poor decision making, high staff turnover
   and absences. My new book, Beyond the Medical Gaze: Practicing
   Psychologically Informed Healthcare, provides an evidence-based
   approach that embeds contemporary understanding in psychological and
   emotional health into healthcare practice.

   Drawing on contemporary theories such as Polyvagal Theory, attachment
   theory, compassion-based, and trauma-informed approaches, I seek to
   offer a comprehensive framework for healthcare practitioners,
   policymakers, and educators incorporating reflective exercises,
   real-life testimonials, case studies, examples of innovative practice
   and research, and practical handouts. A final chapter is provided for
   therapists working with this client population or supporting healthcare
   teams. The core principles of R.E.S.P.E.C.T. framework provides a lens
   to consider healthcare from a Psychologically Informed approach, as
   I'll now outline.

Relational safety…

   … through compassion focused healthcare delivery, leadership and teams.

   When someone is unwell and in need of medical attention, it can be
   incredibly stressful for them and their loved ones and it is natural
   for them to look to others for support. As social beings we have
   evolved to build trusting relationships with others from a neurological
   foundation of psychological safety. We seek signals of safety through
   compassion via vocal tone, facial expressions, body language, trust
   signals and reciprocity, especially during times of adversity (Porges,
   2022). While studies suggest that survival rates increase when doctors
   make eye contact and provide a reassuring handshake to patients
   (Field et al., 2010) shortcomings have been reported in health systems
   due to a 'compassion crisis' in healthcare delivery. Compassionate
   communication through active listening, co-regulation, consistency of
   care, techniques for delivering difficult news, establishing trust, age
   appropriate and neuro-affirmative communication should be an essential
   component of training for all healthcare professionals.

Empowerment…

   … by supporting self-management, healthcare literacy and by challenging
   disempowering aspects of healthcare.

   Self-management (medical, behavioural and emotional) promotes
   psychological safety among those dealing with chronic illness. This
   includes partnership working between patient and medical teams, shared
   decision making, informing and engaging patients in making choices
   whilst being mindful that in the 'patient role' many of us feel
   more vulnerable. Providing accessible information, taking concerns
   seriously and promoting dignity can facilitate empowerment and
   healthcare literacy. Challenging disempowering aspects of care (e.g.
   patient waiting, backless gowns, epistemic injustice, holding and
   restraint) can also support wellbeing and mitigate medically related
   trauma.

Soothing presence…

   … of caregivers across the healthcare journey.

   Some of my most difficult childhood memories are of being wheeled away
   by a team in green scrubs to go to the operating theater, where my mum
   was not allowed. The protective presence of the primary care giver is
   essential to minimise the impact of early adversity, provide comfort
   and to support normal development and secure attachment. Yet, there can
   be medical interruptions to the child's innate need for responsive
   caregivers, touch, connection, belonging, consistency, validation, play
   and learning. Recurrent medical trauma can impact on emotional
   development, impairing the development of self-soothing and emotional
   regulation, across the lifespan. Promoting the soothing presence of
   loved ones needs to be supported across healthcare practice. For
   example, studies demonstrate that parental holding of infants improves
   haemodynamics in the cardiac ICU (Elhoff et al, 2023) while Kangaroo
   care reduces mortality, infection, length of hospital stay and pain
   responses in preterm babies (Campbell-Yeo et al, 2022).

Psychological safety (Polyvagal informed)…

   … by validating a normal response to adverse circumstances,
   incorporating coping strategies throughout healthcare delivery and by
   supporting wellbeing for healthcare staff.

   Polyvagal Theory offers a 'Science of safety' proposing that we
   constantly evaluate our world for threat and safety, termed
   Neuroception. We have evolved a hierarchical 'defense' system to this
   end (Porges, 2022). By paying attention to the patient's voice tone,
   facial expressions, and body language healthcare professionals can
   better understand and validate their response and help to shift this
   through containment and co-regulation.

   To this end, it is important to validate normal reactions to distress
   and pain whilst being careful about rewarding emotional
   suppression (e.g. 'Bravery' stickers and 'hero' costumes). Healthcare
   professionals can facilitate coping strategies such as a cuddle from
   parent, humour, distraction, anesthetic cream, stress reduction
   exercises, emotional preparation for procedures, a supportive visit
   from hospital chaplain / specialist nurse, and by screening mental
   health and referring on to further support as indicated.

   It is important for healthcare organisations to promote psychological
   safety for staff too, through compassionate leadership which promotes
   healthy boundaries, self-care, self-compassion, safe spaces to process
   and share difficult feelings and understanding, recognising and
   treating burnout, vicarious trauma and compassion fatigue (e.g. using
   Wellness Action Plans).

Environments…

   … that better support healing, recovery, rest and wellbeing.

   Healing healthcare environments are fundamental to rest and recovery,
   yet clinical environments can be noisy and bright whilst lacking
   in privacy. Excessive sound and noise in the Intensive Care Unit has
   been linked with adverse and potentially preventable patient outcomes,
   staff errors and dissatisfaction (Tronstad et al., 2024)
   while ward routines often arranged to suit healthcare professionals
   rather than patients' needs for sleep and rest. There are many changes
   that could be made to promote calm and privacy while limiting
   disruptions to sleep. Further, incorporation of green spaces,
   neuro-affirmative spaces and age-appropriate care (e.g. spaces for
   teenagers) could also improve patient wellbeing.

Culturally sensitive healthcare provision…

   … that tackles ableism, recognizing health inequalities and
   intersectionality.

    It is essential to recognise that people with CHCs have experienced
   social exclusion, segregation and stigma throughout history. As
   inherently social beings, exclusion from our social group can activate
   the threat system, leading to panic, anger, and shame (Gilbert, 2018).
   Further, CHCs are more prevalent among lower socioeconomic and other
   marginalised groups while people living with CHCs face disparities in
   income, education, employment and representation (Bogart, 2020).
   Children with CHCs, can face exclusion from physical education and play
   and on average, perform worse in school  (Jay et al, 2023). Culturally
   sensitive healthcare is a vehicle for decreasing health disparities by
   recognizing, respecting and responding to the cultural needs of
   individuals and tackling systemic stigma within healthcare systems.

Trauma informed practice and environments

   Each time I attend a healthcare setting, in my mind, I can momentarily
   flit back to being a child again. I feel butterflies in my stomach,
   catch my breath, feel my body tense and struggle to assert myself.
   Being trauma informed involves recognising when someone has been
   affected by trauma and collaboratively adjusting your work to consider
   this. For example, feeling safe has also been found to improve healing
   and recovery during maternity care of women who have experienced
   childhood sexual trauma, while feeling unsafe with professionals could
   be experienced as retraumatization (Montgomery, 2013). Trauma-informed
   organisations embed the principles of safety, compassion,
   trustworthiness, choice, collaboration and empowerment into all aspects
   of their work and consider the needs of healthcare workers in
   responding to people affected by trauma to prevent vicarious trauma.
