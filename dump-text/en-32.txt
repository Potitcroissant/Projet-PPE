   A Beginner's Guide to The Gaze

A Beginner's Guide to The Gaze

   November 19, 2019
   by Nonclassical

   The gaze – or the male gaze, more specifically – is a discourse that
   disects how we look at visual representations in film, advertising and
   art. Coined by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey in her seminal 1975
   essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, Laura argues that
   persepctives in visual media are often built from the viewpoint of a
   hetrosexual male, where  women are viewed through this lens. The result
   is that women are often depicted in a sexualised way, where their value
   is judged based on their appearance. At its heart, women are viewed as
   objects of male desire. On 21 Nov, curator Lola de la Mata has
   programmed an evening which explores and challenge this notion of the
   gaze.

Through another’s eyes

   One way of understanding the male gaze in action is to consider you as
   the viewer. Take for example the painting below:

   Professor Andrew Lear notes that the woman in this painting by Francois
   Gérard (Princess of Talleyrand) shows her looking away from you, the
   viewer. You are playing an active role in observing, yet she is looking
   away. Rather than the subject considering the viewer – as art historian
   John Berger notes – they are considering how the viewer sees them.

   Let’s look at this idea when it comes to Sissy Fatigue, a 2019
   collaborative film from 4:3 productions featuring in our next event.
   The short film begins with performer Olivia Norris’ character displayed
   as a sexualised blonde – the focus isn’t on her face, but her hair and
   body as she dances flirtatiously in front of a boy.

   'Sissy Fatigue' follows the insidious transformation of seductive
   blonde woman into rage fuelled, lip-syncing, six pack tricking, pearl
   dripping, bald creature.

   However, this is quickly subverted once the blonde wig is removed.
   Olivia morphs into a dominant character, staring directly into the
   camera without losing eye contact. It makes the viewer feel
   uncomfortable, prompting us to question – how do we perceive women
   through fetishised blondeness and stereotypical femininity?

Behind the camera

   But the concept of the gaze goes much further than just the position of
   the viewer. Women have often been viewed as submissive characters in
   film, advertising and visual media in other ways. For example, nearly
   50% of contemporary films fail the Bechdel test – a simple evaluation
   that qualifies the film as having two named female characters who have
   a conversation about something other than men. In the absence of strong
   speaking roles and characters which are as nuanced or instrumental to
   the plot as the male lead, the female roles in film and television thus
   only become important in relation to the male characters, portraying
   women as submissive to men. Posters for such films further objectify
   and trivialise female presence in the media: there’s  even a Tumblr
   account – The Headless Women of Hollywood – which shows the number of
   posters which obscure the heads and faces of women in favour of more
   sexualised body imagery.

   Exploring these concepts in a visually compelling piece, Q-Hubris is
   another work featuring on 21 Nov. Created and performed by Riccardo T
   and Antonio Branco, Q-Hubris addresses the power dynamics in the
   relationship between idol and worshipper, inviting the audience to
   consider their objectification of the performers. Through covering a
   near-naked body in gold leaf, the pair use daring costume and
   confrontational movement to address the gaze, both upon each other and
   from the audience. Q-Hubris also takes the concept of the male gaze
   beyond gender, exploring the power structures of the superior and
   submissive throughout society: between pop stars and fans, white people
   and every other race, those who identify as cis/heterosexual and the
   LGBTQ+ community.

   Prominent both historically and in contemporary media, the male gaze
   inevitably influences the way that not only men, but women perceive and
   relate to other women and themselves, reinforcing the objectification
   of women, both in art and  in society. See how Lola de la Mata turns
   the concept of the gaze on it’s head in her discussion about the
   curatorial process.
