   Join an artist, a historian and a philosopher to explore the concept of
   the gaze within the visual arts​

   In the first of a three-part series responding to the All Too Human
   exhibition, an artist, historian and philosopher explore the concept of
   the gaze within the visual arts, its power to objectify or be
   objective, create intimacy or distance. Speakers include visual artist
   Amalia Ulman, art historian Katharina Guenther and philosopher Timothy
   Secret.
   The panel discussion will be chaired by Dr. Sacha Golob from The Centre
   for Philosophy and the Visual Arts, King's College London.

Biographies

Sacha Golob

   Sacha Golob is a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at King’s College London
   and the Director of the Centre for Philosophy and the Visual Arts;
   before joining King’s, he was a Fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge. He has
   published extensively on French and German Philosophy, and the
   Philosophy of Art. His current research explores contemporary
   conceptions of virtue and degeneration.

Katharina Guenther

   Katharina Guenther is an art historian. Her work focuses on post-war
   and contemporary painting and photography. She graduated from the
   University of Cologne in 2009 and has since researched and published
   for the Estate of Francis Bacon at Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane
   and Tate Britain, the Francis Bacon MB Art Foundation Monaco and the
   John Deakin Archive, and is currently working as project manager of the
   official website of the Estate of Francis Bacon, francis-bacon.com. She
   is in the final stage of a Ph.D. thesis exploring Francis Bacon's
   relationship to photography at the University of Cologne.

Timothy Secret

   Timothy Secret is a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of
   Winchester. His recent work focuses on death, mourning and madness in
   contemporary French thought. His book The Politics and Pedagogy of
   Mourning was recently published in paperback by Bloomsbury. Since being
   awarded the title BBC & AHRC New Generation Thinker, he has made
   numerous media appearances and worked with a selection of contemporary
   artists.

Amalia Ulman

   Amalia Ulman (b. 1989) is an artist based in Los Angeles. Born in
   Argentina but raised in Spain, she studied Fine Arts at Central Saint
   Martins in London. Her works, which are primarily voiced in the first
   person, blur the distinction between the artist and object of study,
   often creating humorous, gentle deceptions, while exploring class
   imitation and the relationship between consumerism and identity. In
   addition to video, sculpture and installation work, her
   multidisciplinary practice has involved the use of social media,
   magazine photoshoots, interviews, self-promotion and brand endorsements
   as tools for the fabrication of fictional narratives. Ulman’s
   performance Excellences & Perfections was archived by Rhizome and the
   New Museum (New York) and exhibited at the Tate Modern and Whitechapel
   Gallery (London). Her most recent works are the video essay Annals of
   Private History (Frieze Live, 2015), and Privilege (online performance,
   2016) and its subsequent solo shows: Labour Dance at Arcadia Missa
   (London), Reputation at New Galerie (Paris), Dignity at James Fuentes
   (New York), Intolerance at BARRO (Buenos Aires), Monday Cartoons at
   Deborah Schamoni (Munich), Atchoum! at Galerie Sympa (Figeac) and NEW
   WORLD 1717 at Rockbund Art Museum (Shanghai).

The Gaze Seminar

   Following the panel discussion there will be a seminar from 15.30–17.30
   in the Duffield Room. This two hour seminar explores some of the key
   philosophical issues raised by the notion of the gaze.

   The first half opens with Jean-Paul Sartre's classic discussion: Sartre
   uses the story of a voyeur caught in the act to explore objectification
   and shame through the lens of the gaze. We'll examine how the gaze
   relates to gender and subjectivity, and we'll consider to what degree
   it might be a positive, as well as a negative, phenomenon. The second
   half broadens the discussion to look at the gaze across different
   formats – how should we understand it in the context of painting,
   photography, social media or even writing?
   The session will provide a concise introduction to the core theme and
   its significance for philosophy and the arts. We’ll then break into
   smaller groups for a guided discussion in which participants can
   explore the ideas and develop their own take on them in relation to the
   exhibition and to contemporary events.
   The seminar will be led by Dr. Sacha Golob, Dr. Emma Syea and Vanessa
   Brassey from the King's College London, Centre for Philosophy and the
   Visual Arts. Participants will have the opportunity to contribute to a
   research article on the relationship between philosophy and their
   experience of the All Too Human exhibition.

   No prior knowledge of the subject or background in philosophy is
   required. The maximum capacity of this seminar is 28 people.
   This event is part of the three-part series: What Makes Us Human:
   Conversation on Art and Philosophy.

   ‘Philosophy in the Gallery’ is a collaboration between The Centre for
   Philosophy and the Visual Arts at King's College London and Tate,
   supported by the Cultural Institute at King's
