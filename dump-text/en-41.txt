   Suzanne Valadon's La Joie de Vivre

   Elizabeth Macneal’s The Doll Factory is an intoxicating story of love,
   art, obsession, and one woman’s struggle for freedom and agency in
   Victorian London. Throughout this enthralling debut, Elizabeth brings
   the prevalence and ramifications of the male gaze into the spotlight.
   Here, journalist Naomi Frisby explores the parallels that can be drawn
   with today’s society, and the implications this has for us all.

   ‘I am a woman, not an exhibit.’ – Iris Whittle

   In 1975, film critic Laura Mulvey coined the term ‘the male gaze’. It
   refers to the presentation of women in visual arts and literature from
   a male, heterosexual perspective where women are depicted as sexual
   objects for the pleasure of the male viewer. Men have agency; women are
   passive and dehumanised.

    The first time ‘Starey’ Silas Reed and Louis Frost, the central male
   characters in The Doll Factory, encounter the novel’s protagonist, Iris
   Whittle, the emphasis is on them looking at her. Silas, the proprietor
   of a shop of curiosities, notices Iris on the way to The Great
   Exhibition. He sees her height, her red hair, her womanliness. Iris
   reminds him of Flick, his childhood friend, and this alone is enough
   for him to believe that he and Iris have a connection, ‘an invisible
   cord which united them’.

    Louis, a fictional member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, is out in
   London with Dante Gabriel Rosetti and John Everett Millais looking for
   ‘stunners’, the term the PRB assigned to the women who became their
   models. When Louis complains he cannot find anyone for his latest
   painting, The Imprisonment of Gugimar’s Queen, Silas, desperate to
   ingratiate himself with these men, tells them about Iris. They visit
   the shop where Iris is employed to paint dolls and stare at her through
   the window.

    By linking Silas and Louis, Elizabeth Macneal makes a direct
   correlation between the male gaze in art and the male gaze in society.
   The legacy of the PRB is one of red-haired, pale-skinned, long-necked
   women posed as courtly lovers in ancient, medieval or Shakespearian
   tales. The women connected to the movement are remembered as models,
   despite several of them – including Elizabeth Siddal – being painters
   in their own right. Laura Mulvey also made this connection. She
   described the male gaze as a social construct, emphasising that if
   women are seen as objects to be valued for their beauty, physique and
   sex appeal in art, they will also be seen as such in life.

    The male gaze and the idea that men are entitled to women’s bodies
   remain threaded throughout society. Only 30% of the art housed in the
   Tate group of galleries is by women.  Female characters made up just
   35% of speaking roles in the highest grossing films of 2018 - none of
   which had a female director. Women are more likely to read an equal
   number of books by male and female writers, while men predominantly
   read books by other men. As long as female artists aren’t considered
   equal to male artists, aren’t allowed to take up an equal amount of
   space, aren’t heard, women will continue to be viewed through the eyes
   of men who’ve fashioned them via their desires. This has serious
   repercussions: from street harassment - in the form of comments,
   gestures, whistling, following and touching - to assault and rape, men
   take their cues from the portrayal of women in art and literature.

    Silas’ obsession with Iris builds throughout The Doll Factory. Through
   his watching, he creates an idealised picture of a woman who will meet
   his every whim. His Iris responds with adoration. In reality, she
   barely remembers him.

    Macneal chooses an alternate route for Louis. When he approaches her
   to be his model, Iris is unimpressed with his insistence that ‘You must
   be my Queen’, wanting more than to be immortalised and admired. As the
   novel progresses, Louis begins to see Iris in a different way; his
   understanding of her as a person changes the focus of his painting and
   his idea of love.

    But the real triumph of The Doll Factory is Iris. The story begins
   with her painting a self-portrait in secret, the act of which provides
   her with a sense of control over her own body. When she agrees to model
   for Louis, she insists she will only do so if Louis teaches her to
   paint. Iris has agency which she refuses to relinquish. She is
   ambitious and ‘will not be afraid to take up space’.

    There is hope in current society too. Social media movements such as
   #EverydaySexism and #MeToo have amplified women’s voices about the
   effects of the male gaze, while #AskHerMore and #ReadWomen highlighted
   women’s contributions to visual arts and literature.

    This year, the women associated with the PRB will finally have their
   agency recognised too. The work of twelve artists, including Elizabeth
   Siddal, Joanne Wells and Marie Spartali Stillman, is to be exhibited at
   the National Portrait Gallery under the title Pre-Raphaelite Sisters.
   They will take up space and begin to shift the emphasis from being
   admired for their looks to being credited for their talent. Iris’ words
   could act as the exhibition’s subtitle: ‘I’m not a piece of canvas -
   I’m a real woman.’

    In this interview Elizabeth Macneal discusses her inspiration for The
   Doll Factory and the women of the pre-Raphaelite movement:
