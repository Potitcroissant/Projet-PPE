   Male Gaze (trope)
   Oh? What's in her pocket?
   Meryl: I'll go on ahead, look at my ass.
   Snake: Okay. Cool.
   — Metal Gear Awesome

   The Male Gaze is a form of Gaze that arises from the assumption that
   the audience is mostly composed of straight males, which in turn means
   female fanservice will appear in some form to appeal to or appease said
   male audience.

   The usual result of Male Gaze is the way a (usually male) director
   and/or cameraman's interest in women shapes his shots, leading to a
   focus on breasts, legs, buttocks, and other jiggly bits even when the
   film isn't necessarily supposed to be a feast for eyes of their
   admirers (though most of the time this can indeed be intentional). For
   example, a sex scene between a man and a woman may show more of her
   body than it does of his, or focus more on her reactions than his (see
   Right Through His Pants). Alternatively, it could appear in shows that
   aren't overtly sexual — for example, scenes of bikini-clad female
   characters talking that emphasize their bodies rather than showing just
   their heads. This trope can be used as a legitimate cinematic effect,
   especially when combined with Point of View. (At that point it may
   become Eating the Eye Candy, though not necessarily.)

   The term also applies in other media, such as video games and comic
   books. During the Dark Age, comic books were (and often still are)
   perfect examples of the male gaze, with scenes being framed to show off
   a female character's curves over everything else. It can occur in
   non-visual media too - when a female character is introduced, the
   narration will often spend a disproportionate amount of words on
   describing her appearance.

   Male Gaze does sometimes focus on male attributes, focusing on big
   pumping biceps and perfect abs, but, crucially, in a way that is
   sexless and aspirational. The presumed male audience is intended to
   relate to the character being objectified in this way and wish they had
   that body themselves, rather than desire the character.

   The Distaff Counterpart of the Male Gaze is the Female Gaze — where the
   same rules as above apply except the focus is on more traditionally
   masculine qualities in a character.

   If the woman in question is aware of the Fourth Wall, she'll likely
   snap "Ahem, eyes are up here!" at the camera/artist/character.

   The concept was popularized in Laura Mulvey's 1973 essay "Visual
   Pleasure and Narrative Cinema."

   Boobs-and-Butt Pose, Head-and-Hip Pose. Contrast Longing Look, and
   compare with Female Gaze.

       Advertising
     * A Coke commercial featured a trio of guys at a party with a trio of
       girls. The viewer does not see any of the girls' faces, and the
       camera focuses solely on their tight clothing.
     * The Brazilian Butt Lift Commercials are full of Male Gaze.
       Admittedly, this is a service that would be difficult to sell
       without use of Male Gaze.
     * Evony's banner ads feature little more than a pair of gigantic
       boobs accompanied by the words "Play now, my lord!" or "Save your
       lover the Queen!" or "One click for a Roman Orgy!". Evony is a
       Civilization-esque strategy game.
     * The ad for Rappelz starts with a close up of a female upper chest
       with the caption 'like what you see?'. Even when it zooms out a
       little, the focus is still there. The fact that she's wearing a
       Breast Plate doesn't help its cause.
     * The banner ads for Claymore on this very wiki. The vertical one is,
       well, ok, showing a full body shot of one of the female characters
       decked out for battle. What does the horizontal view do? It starts
       out showing only her chest. It then moves further up her body as
       the ad continues, but the shot of her breasts does its job at
       catching your eye. Feel free to make the comparison yourself
       [external_link.gif] .
     * Similarly for the Dragonaut: The Resonance ad. It doesn't seem to
       focus on anything, but the text makes it clear what you're supposed
       to be looking at 'Real dragons have curves'. Ironically they chose
       the least noticeable female dragon to portray.
          + The ads for "Part 2" are similar; the vertical one is okay,
            but the horizontal one starts out with a shameless buttocks
            shot. Funi certainly knows how to attract the show's target
            audience.
     * This commercial for Corona light beer [external_link.gif] .
     * This commercial for Reebok EasyTone shoes [external_link.gif] ,
       designed to "make your legs and butt look good". The ad is a
       pleasantly-constructed young woman in short shorts expounding on
       the virtues of the shoes in question, and the cameraman taking
       notice of the effect the shoes have on her legs and butt.
       Naturally, her response is an unamused "eyes up here" gesture.
          + Their ads are [external_link.gif] ostensibly aimed at women.
            Maybe gay/bi women are a huge target audience for Reebok?
     * An advertisement for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia played with
       this trope, showing the male gaze until the camera pans up
       revealing the woman in question to be the hideous (under the
       makeup, the actress is rather attractive) Margaret McPoyle.
     * Played with in a Jean-Paul Gautier perfume campaign. The ad for the
       male perfume is typical male-gaze: a sailor leaves a woman after a
       night of passion; she's shown half naked, writhing in the sheets.
       The ad for the female perfume is exactly the same, except it's the
       woman leaving and the sailor writhing half naked in the sheets.
     * In Killing Us Softly: Advertising's View of Women, her major
       lecture series, Jean Kilbourne argues that the male gaze is so
       pervasive in modern culture, particularly advertising, that it has
       changed the way that women look at each other - that even
       heterosexual women look at other women in the way that a
       heterosexual man would.
     * Done with a surprising amount of subtlety for an Axe hair gel
       commercial: A walking messy mop of hair is trying to get the
       attention of a pair of breasts that works with him. It's not until
       he uses the product in question that both he and woman see each
       other as complete people. This is followed by the caption: "Hair,
       it's what women see first" So what does that say about men?
     * An advert for a South African fast food chain stated that they
       could tell where you'd be looking at and prove it by showing a
       video. Cue the first part of the advert showing a X going onto
       woman's breasts and the like and the second part showing it going
       more onto the burger video on the other side than onto the girls
       (although it tried to cut back to them).
     * Averted in one commercial^note Maybe Snickers or Klondike where a
       guy keeps his eyes focused on the woman before him and doesn't even
       pass a glance at Ms. Fanservice walking by. Result, he should get
       what the commercial was advertising.
     * The very first shot of the inspirational women's fitness ad "This
       Girl Can" [external_link.gif] is of a woman's backside in a
       two-piece bathing suit as she walks towards a swimming pool, slides
       her fingers into her bikini bottoms, and snaps them across her
       behind. In a subversion, the ad is explicitly aimed at women, and
       opening shot isn't intended as Fanservice—it's intended to
       encourage women to exercise without being ashamed of their bodies.
     * Many men (most infamously [external_link.gif] Chicago Sun-Times
       columnist Richard Roeper) fell back on this to complain about
       Dove's Real Beauty Campaign ads that dared to—gasp!—portray women
       of various ethnicities and body sizes rather than the typical
       stick-thin Caucasian blonde model. The idea that the ads were
       targeted at women rather than at men looking for something to ogle
       apparently never occurred to them.
     * The NSFW ' Juiced'' teaser has this as soon as the men decide to
       test out the extent of their controller's power by drastically
       shortening the skirt of a nearby woman, exposing most of her legs
       in the process as she meekly places her hands over her groin and
       looks around. Once the woman gets a breast expansion the camera
       lingering on her chest as her breasts bounce around, much to her
       confusion and the delight of the men. It only escalates from there
       as the men quickly remove her top and what's left of her skirt,
       leaving her in just a g-string as the traffic begins to pick up
       around her. This trope reaches its climax once the men become even
       more excited and start giggling at the woman's plight. As the
       commercial gets closer to the end with the woman spinning in place
       and leaving her entire body exposed for everybody to see before her
       arms are raised behind her head in order to expose her entire
       figure. As her spinning starts to end, the camera cuts to showing
       just the woman's scantly clad pelvis as she's turned around a few
       more times, making sure that the audience is looking at the exact
       things that the men are focused on at this point, while the Juiced
       logo gets branded onto her butt. And then they remotely smack her
       rear with their controllers. And if what this article
       [external_link.gif] has to say on the matter is taken at face
       value, the men eventually strip the woman of her last article of
       clothing after the ad ends.

       Fan Works
     * Advice and Trust: Shinji has a hard time not gawking openly at
       Asuka's body. After getting together, it is even harder for him. He
       stares at her the whole time, but he still tries to be discreet
       about it since they are trying to keep a Secret Relationship. For
       example, in chapter 3, Asuka is (pretending) lecturing him about
       the water being too hot, but Shinji is barely keeping track of the
       conversation since he is too busy staring at her bare legs.
       A small part of his brain was concentrating on not dropping the hot
       pot on his feet, because most of it was trying not to drool
       helplessly over the way Asuka's long, smooth legs disappeared up
       under the hem of the towel, mixed in with memories of last night
       that said sight triggered.
     * In Cinema Snob Reviews Frozen, there is a closeup of Elsa's chest
       when Snob asks what Frozen had in common when exploitation films
       (the stuff he usually reviews).
     * Crimson and Emerald: Shouto soothes himself from his family drama
       by staring at Izuku's butt.
     * A Crown of Stars: Shinji is constantly looking at Asuka
       (incidentally, she demands that he does so). For example, in
       chapter 48, Shinji is so distracted staring at Asuka's butt that he
       bumps against her.
       Asuka: Ow! Watch it, Third!
       Shinji: I'm sorr—
       Asuka: I bet I could fling you off this spot hard enough to hit the
       roof of that truck, Third Child. What gives?
       Shinji: Um... I wasn't watching where I was going?
       Asuka: ....you were staring at my ass again, weren't you?
       Shinji: .........yes?
       Asuka: [smirking wickedly] Good.
     * Navarone regularly does this in Diaries of a Madman and openly
       admits it in his narration, particularly later on in the story as
       he becomes more depraved.
     * Doing It Right This Time:
          + Shinji is constantly staring at Asuka and Rei.
          + Chapter 2 gave an example that amusingly combined this with
            Female Gaze: the three pilots go to buy new clothes, Rei tries
            a new dress... and Shinji and Asuka cannot take their eyes off
            her, noticing how the dress clings to her body and shows her
            curves.
     * In Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus, Harry Potter has often
       caught himself staring at Raynare's shapely arse, and not only when
       she's wearing her Stripperific battle outfit.
     * Evangelion 303's female characters provide plenty of eye candy,
       especially Asuka.
     * In chapter 2 of Last Child of Krypton, Kaji and Shinji walk behind
       Misato and Asuka. Kaji advises Shinji to let them walk in front in
       order to enjoy the "sight".
     * Loki: Agent of Doomgard has an in-universe example:
       Mini!Thunderstrike met Story!Loki as a woman first, so he planned
       to spend the time on the assignment with ogling her ass... who at
       that point decided to change gender to male, to Thunderstrike's
       great disappointment. Loki pointing out that he can still do the
       ogling "somehow" didn't make him feel any better.
     * The Myth of Link & Zelda: Breath of the Wild: While Zelda is
       enjoying her view of the shirtless muscular Link, Link himself is
       stealing himself some glances at Zelda's curvaceous body. Oh, and
       he's fully aware of how much Zelda's enjoying her view of him.
     * In Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide, the point of view often
       focuses on Asuka's body and how Shinji reacts to it.
     * A New Life Era: Bertha flirts with Moe with her chest in this story
       [external_link.gif] . Amy Jr. is not pleased.
     * Pokémon Reset Bloodlines:
          + In the main story, at the beginning of the Mewtwo Strikes Back
            arc, Ash and his female companions are enjoying a day off at
            the beach. At one point Misty comes out of the water after
            some diving, and Ash stares at her bikini-clad body, with the
            narration even mentioning how he follows a droplet as it rolls
            down her cleavage and then her stomach.
          + In the Holiday Special 2017, a snippet stars a boy named
            Vermell who keeps staring at Hilda's shorts, prompting her to
            say "My eyes are 44.7º up, boy."
     * Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton: The narration notes
       several times that Asuka's costumes inevitably draw the eye to her
       bosom cause the "boob window" of the first outfit and the "S"
       emblem of the second.
       Her tight blue shirt made her not inconsiderable curves very
       apparent, and the yellow and red shield emblem with the "S" inside
       it on her chest only served to draw the eye to that area.

       Films — Animation
     * Intentionally used and justified in Animalympics. Marathon runner
       Kit Mambo explains her strategy to win the gold medal over her
       rival René Fromage thusly — she'll take a quick lead, and then
       "break his concentration". The interview footage spells it out by
       focusing on Kit's butt as she runs.
     * Parodied in Antz when Weaver meets Azteca. The camera switches to
       his perspective as Weaver checks out her legs… which are four
       completely alien-looking limbs that don’t even look remotely
       attractive to humans. She then directs his attention back to her
       eyes.
     * Boys Night Out: EVERYWHERE. There are many shots focusing on the
       strippers' legs, butts, and breasts.
     * Elastigirl in The Incredibles. There's even one scene where she
       sighs after seeing the size of her behind in a mirror.
       [external_link.gif] ◊
     * Played for Laughs with a good dose of Squick in The Little Mermaid:
       of all female characters who could have a chance to show their
       curves, Ursula the sea witch is the one who spends a good part of
       her screentime shaking her BODY LANGUAGE!! in front of the camera.
     * Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs has Scratte's big butt shown.
     * Luck (2022): Some scenes focus on Sam Greenfield's butt, even when
       she tries to position herself above the toilet.
     * Madagascar had Gloria the hippo, whose big butt is shown on screen
       several times throughout each movie, video game, and animated
       short.
     * In One Stormy Night, Gabu has a tendency to stare at Mei's arse,
       which the POV camera delightedly shows off. It's a rather unusual
       example given that Gabu is a wolf, Mei is a goat, and that he's
       staring because he wants to eat him. (apparently, anyway...)
     * Ratatouille: After Linguini and Colette get together, there's a
       slow pan-up of Colette as they work in the kitchen, presumably from
       Linguini's perspective.
     * The Super Mario Bros. Movie: Peach gets a fair amount of gaze
       moments thanks to all of them being from Mario's point-of-view. One
       notable moment is done as the heroes get into karts and drive past
       some nice scenery, with the camera following Mario's eyes as Peach
       revs in front of him, her biker suit putting her rear on full
       display.
     * In Scooby-Doo: Camp Scare, when Daphne and Velma were disrobing
       into their swimsuits while getting ready to go swimming, the camera
       moved slowly to show their whole bodies [external_link.gif] .
     * Tangled: Mother Gothel invokes the Ms. Fanservice trope by letting
       her breasts look protruded and Shaking the Rump occasionally.
     * Zootopia:
          + Some scenes focus on Judy Hopps's butt, especially when she
            tries to get on a chair.
          + Gazelle is a much bigger contender here, given that some shots
            give focus to her chest and her hind, especially whenever she
            performs on stage.

       Literature
     * Roman Kendar's POV scenes in City of No End have a few Male Gaze
       moments, particularly when he meets Sibyla Leibowitz and when the
       Norns bring out singers to entertain him on his diplomatic mission.
       This doesn't happen in scenes from the POV of other characters,
       however.
     * The Elenium: Empress Elysoun is a female example of the Walking
       Shirtless Scene, and during a banquet, a handful of characters
       could not help but notice how big her naked breasts are.
     * In The Hunchback of Notre Dame, when Esmeralda is being taken to
       the gallows, Victor Hugo spends an inordinate amount of page space
       describing her "long black hair... more lustrous than the raven's
       wing," her "half-naked shoulders" and "bare legs," and her
       desperate attempts to hold her garment closed with her teeth.
     * In a lot of Lin Carter's works, (particularly Zanthodon) he'll
       often spend a paragraph repeating descriptions of all the naked or
       scantily-clad female characters' attributes every couple of pages.
       You could make a drinking game out of all the times he uses the
       phrases like "flawless breasts", "supple body", "luscious mouth".
       Doesn't help that they are often threatened with rape by pirates or
       savages every few chapters as well.
     * A short story by French author Anna Gavalda centers around the Male
       Gaze. The protagonist, a single woman, goes to the bar in search of
       some fun. A man starts talking to her boobs, but she refuses to
       acknowledge him. He even switches language from French to English,
       before he thinks to look two decimeters higher. "Fancy that! I have
       a face, too!" she thinks, before telling him off.
     * Milton's frequent descriptions of the beautiful, graceful Eve in
       Paradise Lost.
     * Most of the female characters in the entirety of The Dresden Files,
       especially the many fairies and White Court vampires.
       Harry (narrating): One thing Spenser fails to mention is that the
       Faerie Queen has a great ass.
          + Although it might not immediately be obvious, this tends to be
            much more blatant when Harry (the first person narrator for
            the entire series) is single and particularly when he's
            sexually frustrated, and is considerably toned down when he's
            in a relationship.
     * Elizabeth George is guilty of this in her book Careless in Red,
       where everyone, including the women make assessments of the women's
       looks by zooming in on their body type and clothing. This is where
       we get women doing almost pornographic descriptions of other women
       "as if to check out the competition", as George puts it although
       there is no man around. For some reason all the characters also
       seems to have the same standards of beauty, and write off women who
       are too fat or too skinny as impossible love interests for the
       victim, since "she could never be the subject of a young man's
       lustful gaze".
     * John Carter of Mars is an officer and a gentleman. Except for a
       reference to Dejah Thoris' 'perfectly symmetrical figure' and an
       occasional 'bare shoulder' you would never guess he is surrounded
       by pulchritudinous damsels clad in nothing more than leather straps
       and jewelry.
     * In Lee Child's Without Fail, Jack Reacher's partner Frances Neagley
       has buttocks which regularly get noted approvingly (even by the
       book's other main female character). This actually proves to be
       plot-relevant. When they have a word with the man handling Secret
       Service surveillance tapes - who tampered with them as part of the
       plot to assassinate the Vice-President-elect because the people
       responsible kidnapped his wife - he's so nervous he never even
       notices Neagley's behind, which he would certainly have done
       otherwise.
     * Knaves on Waves directly subverts this. At one point, Sheridan
       strips naked in front of Trigger, who is solely interested in her
       countless tattoos. Sheridan even remarks that this make him an
       anomaly.
     * Pool of Radiance: The female tailoress has to remind Tarl to stop
       looking at Shal while the young mage has to get new clothes made
       for her.
     * Gammla, the Shallow Love Interest of Quest for Fire is framed
       almost entirely though this lens unfortunately. Interestingly
       though, because this is specifically a male neanderthal gaze, it
       often lingers on parts of the body not traditionally considered
       beautiful by modern man such as her hairy arms and round belly.
     * Throne of Glass:
          + Even before he got to know her, Dorian was shining one of
            these on Celaena.
          + Chaol is more subtle than Dorian, but this is present in his
            POV all the same.
     * In The Wheel of Time, so many of the main cast are implausibly
       beautiful, this happens a lot in-universe.
          + Happens to Min a fair amount. Other important female
            characters frequently call her breeches indecent, while
            themselves showing off vast ... tracts of land.
          + Elayne and Nynaeve roller-coastered this trope during their
            adventures. To the point of being unreliable narrators about
            it.
          + As usual for them, the Aiel completely ignore this trope,
            except in shaming "Wetlanders". Their sweat tents are co-ed.
          + Special mention to Birgitte, who wears high heels and wears
            pants in an era of corsets. After Birgitte ranted about how
            all of the Elayne's allies' houses sent children to help
            fight, Elayne's advisor points out that they have to work with
            what they have, others (including her) have survived similar
            circumstances, and then serves Birgitte:
       "... If you can't keep him reined in as Captain-General, I suggest
       you try walking for him. The way he was eyeing those breeches of
       yours, he'll follow anywhere you lead."
     * At one point in War of the Dreaming, Wendy and Galen enter the
       dream-world to consult with Prometheus. On "waking" up, Wendy
       demands to know why, if they are climbing a mountain, she is
       dressed in high heels and fishnet stockings. Galen starts to
       explain that it's his dream they are in, and this is how he always
       thought of-- uh, that it's symbolic.
     * In Shadowboy, the narrator is a Hormone-Addled Teenager, leading to
       moments of distraction, in particular when he first meets Pam.
     * The Honorverse is actually very good about avoiding this.... except
       when it comes to Eloise Pritchart, one of the later series' anchor
       characters. This is less "Male Gaze" and more "Everyone's Gaze",
       though, as she really is apparently just that gorgeous — something
       which every character who personally meets her for the first time
       will invariably dwell upon for a paragraph or two before moving on
       with the plotline. To the author's credit, this does not in any way
       diminish her well-rounded characterization or her many moments of
       badass.
     * In the western series of William Johnstone and his niece, J.A.
       Johnstone this is fairly common. One notable example comes from the
       book Sidewinders:Bleeding Texas, when The Dragon is watching the
       daughter of the family he works for walking away and thinking about
       how nice her jeans fit. Unfortunately for him, he isn't too
       discreet about it and his boss notices.
       Nick Fontaine: Stop leering at my sister's behind and get in here.
     * The titular character in the Ciaphas Cain ^note HERO OF THE
       IMPERIUM!! series likes to check out ladies' butts. In Duty Calls,
       this actually saves his life, as craning his neck to see the butt
       of a female just a little bit longer lets him see assassin drones
       coming down from the ceiling before they attack him.
     * We Can Remember It For You Wholesale: In every scene Shirley, the
       topless Rekall receptionist, appears in, the narrator describes how
       shapely her melony breasts are and have a tendency to bounce.
     * When Zachary Beaver Came To Town: Toby often admires the height and
       tightness of Scarlet's jeans, not to mention her bikini top.
     * Yumi and the Nightmare Painter: Between Design's human form being
       very curvy and her not being very careful when she leans over,
       Painter spends a significant amount of time trying very hard to
       look her in the face.
       Hoid: Granted, he did overdo it—his eyes lingered on her the entire
       time she worked. But don't judge him too harshly. He was nineteen,
       and I'm a uniquely talented artist.
     * In The Stainless Steel Rat, the second time Jim meets Angelina, she
       poses as an escort. Despite the changed appearance, he recognizes
       her as soon as he takes a proper look at her face... with the text
       describing in detail how that doesn't happen for quite a while.

       Music
     * Dead Prez's music video to Hip Hop started with a shot of a woman's
       buttocks, which was then captioned with the words: "Now that we got
       your attention". Then raps about social warfare.
     * This is pretty much what Roy Orbison's big hit "Oh, Pretty Woman
       [external_link.gif] " is all about.
     * Male-to-male example: The album art [external_link.gif] ◊ for the
       VENUS song "Wow Wow VENUS" shows DJ Yoshitaka facing Sota Fujimori
       and looking down at his crotch.
     * Surprisingly averted in Juvenile's video for Rodeo. It goes behind
       the scenes at a strip club, showing the difficult lives of the
       strippers. While there are scenes showing them dancing, the camera
       focuses on their faces, showing how many of them are sad, bored,
       worried or stressed.
     * Three words. BABY GOT BACK.
     * Ingrid Michaelson's music video for "Girls Chase Boys"
       [external_link.gif] is a frame-by-frame homage to Robert Palmer's
       music video for "Simply Irresistible" [external_link.gif] with
       herself playing Robert Palmer and the genders of the backup dancers
       randomized.
     * Played every which way with ''Because Boobs."
       Girl: Um, excuse me, my eyes are up here!
       Guy: Yeah, but... your boobs are down there.
     * The Stranglers' "Peaches" may or may not combine this with Dirty
       Old Man.
     * The Zolas's EP Wino Oracle has a track that is literally called
       this.
     * Deliberately over-invoked in Chilly Gonzolas's video for "You Can
       Dance." [external_link.gif] The camera stays locked on the female
       dancers' butts, bosoms and crotches (all clothed), occasionally
       intercut with shots of Chilly getting slapped across the face in
       time with the hand-claps, implying that the whole thing is from his
       perspective.
     * Johnny Tillotson's "Poetry in Motion" [external_link.gif] talks
       about how his girlfriend's graceful Supermodel Strut keeps him
       mesmerized and is the visual equivalent of poetry with Curves in
       All the Right Places.
       Poetry in motion
       Dancing close to me
       A flower of devotion
       A swaying gracefully

       Music Videos
     * Miserable invokes male gaze and uses it as a tool to trick the
       audience. Aside from the Giant Woman wearing nothing but a bikini
       and high-heeled shoes, the band also specifically plays on places
       like her butt, her thighs, and her breasts while the camera pans
       over her body seductively. Combined with her occasional flirtatious
       smiles and giggles directed towards the band, this makes it seem
       like she's just there to be eye candy. So it comes as a suprise
       when the last 17% of the video is dedicated to her gleefully
       devouring the terrified male band members. In a way, this is meant
       to taunt the viewers, who were more likely than not lustful males
       projecting themselves onto the males in the video who they just
       witnessed being utterly emasculated and eaten by the woman.

       Pinball
     * In Eight Ball Deluxe, one of the playfield images is a woman in
       tight jeans with her back to the viewer, leaning over the pool
       table...
     * The playfield for Bally's Xenon shows a woman with her back to the
       player, arms upraised.
     * Evel Knievel features several female fans with large breasts and
       wearing tight T-shirts.
     * The sides of the Baywatch cabinet prominently feature the backsides
       of three female lifeguards, complete with skimpy swimsuits.

       Professional Wrestling
     * Turn on any WWE show later than 1995. Find a woman wrestling and
       chances are the cameras are focusing on her breasts falling out of
       her top, jiggling as she moves, or competing for who can get the
       most buttocks shots. Even more so if she is in any competition that
       is not wrestling, WWE tending to have "bikini contests" and such
       seemingly just to facilitate this, though they seem to be on their
       way out since the return to the PG rating.
     * Played straight during Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling's "sports
       entertainment" era, where what was once among the most fearsome
       women's divisions on the planet was phased out for valets with
       little wrestling or garbage wrestling skills whom the cameras would
       zoom in on while they attempted to fight one another, often to the
       point of missing the actual wrestling moves and violence the
       promotion was built on. However, what was left of the women's
       division was still fearsome enough to convince the cameramen not to
       apply this trope when they were wrestling.
     * During a Full Impact Pro falls count anywhere match between
       Homicide and CM Punk, the camera man, to commentator Prazak's
       annoyance, became more interested in two nearby strippers
       performing. Homicide himself soon became more interested in them
       than Punk too.
     * "Extreme Expose": The segment being the part in the show where
       three scantily clad women - one just barely over the age of 18 -
       dance to club music in the ring. It started as the 18-year-old's
       way to show off how much of an "exhibitionist" she was.
          + Even though Brooke Adams considered her buttocks her best
            assets (no pun intended), one of the cameras that followed her
            seemed more obsessed with them than her.
     * Subverted and Justified in OVW during a Lei'D Tapa vs Blossom Twin
       match, as the camera was being held by Eddy Valiant, whose
       girlfriend Epiphany was later seen demanding him to stop filming.
     * Allysin Kay curtsying before her matches creates a lot of
       opportunities for this.
     * Ivory. Oh yeah. Her fans loved looking at and talking about her
       butt. Google "Ivory's ass" for proof. On April 5, 2002, Steve D.
       Perkins posted "TOP 100 DUMBEST RSPW GAGS" [external_link.gif] to
       the Usenet newsgroup rec.sport.pro-wrestling. "Tributes to Molly's
       or Ivory's ass" came in at #61.
     * Holidead made her Ring of Honor debut [external_link.gif] in a loss
       to Sumie Sakai in a dark match from ROH/NJPW Global Wars 2017 Night
       III, October 14, 2017. One of the commenters said she was "thicc as
       hell," and another said, "That zombie's got a nice ass."
          + She acknowledges this in this post [external_link.gif] , which
            shows her lying face down on the mat and features the words
            "Fans Be Like Dat Ass Tho." Raised to funny because of how she
            quotes the GEICO "Hump Day" ad, asking "Guess what day it is?"

       Radio
     * In one episode of Jack and Millie, Millie's friend Shirley says
       Millie doesn't dress for the male gaze. Millie isn't sure the male
       gays would be interested if she did.

       Sports
     * NFL cheerleaders and NBA dancers.
     * Thanks to Erin Andrews, it has become common for sideline and
       courtside reporters to be female.
     * Very common in the Super Bowl, where most of the national anthem
       singers are women.
     * Spotting pretty women in the crowds of sporting events has become
       such an obvious trope that it has it's own name among cameramen,
       the "Honey Shot." This article [external_link.gif] details how it
       was essentially the brainchild of Andy Sidaris, the director for
       ABC football broadcasts. Note that some women (Jenn Sterger, Pamela
       Anderson) have even gained careers from being spotted in sports
       crowds.
     * During the 2012 Olympic Games, NBC had to pull an online video
       called "Bodies in Motion" because its depiction of female athletes
       was considered objectifying and demeaning. It didn't help that
       during the women's volleyball matches, the cameramen would
       occasionally get...distracted.

       Tabletop Games
     * In the early days of Dungeons & Dragons, it was common to see
       published modules describe any female characters (if they existed
       at all) in detail, usually with terms like "voluptuous" or
       "svelte", while neglecting to give important male NPCs so much as a
       hair color.
          + The illustrations in the D&D books of the 80s and 90s often
            depicted sexily designed and dressed female characters. Clyde
            Caldwell, one of the most prolific (and, in other respects,
            one of the best) D&D artists of this time, is particularly
            infamous for this.

       Webcomics
     * There is a huge amount of buttocks shots in Better Days. This was
       lampshaded fairly early on [external_link.gif] .
     * Ciem Webcomic Series. Candi gets naked a lot more than anyone else.
     * Addressed in this strip [external_link.gif] of Cinema Bums in
       reference to the portrayal of Catwoman in Batman: Arkham City.
     * Discussed in the context of Satan playing video games in this strip
       [external_link.gif] of Dinosaur Comics.
     * In El Goonish Shive, several forms have been designed
       [external_link.gif] by Tedd with this in mind mostly by having huge
       breasts.
     * In Freefall, the inspector that Florence calls up after having the
       spaceship fixed can't help but check out her backside
       [external_link.gif] .
       Savage Chicken AI: Sir, might I suggest your time could be better
       utilized by inspecting my rear end instead of the engineer's?
     * Parodied in Hark! A Vagrant. The Strong Female Characters
       [external_link.gif] are horrible people in outrageously
       Stripperific outfits and poses who insist that because they can
       inflict random violence on men that "sexism is over." Sexy Batman
       [external_link.gif] is just Batman done like a stereotypical female
       comic book character, making cartoonishly seductive comments
       towards Catwoman, using Fanservice and constantly posed to show his
       butt. It's stupid, the implication being that it looks just as
       stupid when done to girl characters.
     * Page 192 [external_link.gif] of Las Lindas has Miles give Sarah's
       feminine curves a lingering gaze when he finds out shes turning 18.
       He quickly learns not to do it again.
     * Shown in this [external_link.gif] Loserz strip.
     * Several cases of Male Gaze occur in Misfile, for example here
       [external_link.gif] . Notable because the breast focus is from
       Ash's perspective, who is the result of a male-to-female Gender
       Bender, while still keeping the male mind.
     * Ronin Galaxy: During the beginning chapter two conflict, Leona’s
       breasts manage to make it into every frame of every.
       [external_link.gif] Single. [external_link.gif] Page.
       [external_link.gif]
     * Illustrated by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, along with Female
       Gaze, here. [external_link.gif]
     * While not overt in Surprising Octeal, the comic seems to pay a lot
       of attention to Suzanne's backside.
     * Silent Hill: Promise The comic often gives a nice view of Vanessa's
       large chest or butt. Additionally, her character portrait is never
       shown wearing the heavy jacket she always has on.
     * Sluggy Freelance:
          + Gratuitous Bikini Shot Sunday [external_link.gif]
          + Pete likes to draw Oasis doing gymnastic moves that highlight
            her figure as a whole. She also seems to get more chest/butt
            closeups than anyone else during the big "Dangerous Days
            Ahead" battle. Like, for example, this [external_link.gif]
            strip.
          + Parodied later in the series when Sasha dresses up
            [external_link.gif] as the supervillainess Monicruel
            [external_link.gif] . While another female supervillain can
            see through the Paper-Thin Disguise, none of the male
            supervilains can because all they noticed about Monicruel's
            appearance was that she had big boobs and wore a monocle. Long
            as Sasha's got those, they can't tell the two women apart,
            even when they're right next to each other, having a catfight
            [external_link.gif] .
            P-man-4: Boobs and monocle! That's her!
            Supervillainess: It's a different face! And totally different
            hairstyle!
            Gennaro: She had hair?
     * In Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff, Hella Jeff takes the opportunity to
       stare at Sweet Bro's mother's ass twice.
       Hella Jeff: dufe, are you SCOPING this bipches CHOICE ASS..
     * Issue #0.1 [external_link.gif] of Unit-M is very guilty of this.
       Subverted in Issue #0.2 [external_link.gif] when the gaze is
       dropped as Shield is harassed over her appearance.

       Web Animation
     * Conker's Etiquette Guide: The third short at one point has Gloria
       Hyman talking to Conker, with a shot from Conker's POV showing a
       closeup of her breasts.
     * In Osanai Nazuna's introduction video, as she questions if her
       name^note Which means "Young Nazuna" implies that she's childish,
       the camera then zooms onto her large bust, prompting a shocked
       remark from OsaNazu, concerned with being potentially banned on
       YouTube despite just starting off.

       Western Animation
     * American Dad!:
          + Francine is often subject to this with major focus during her
            Supermodel Strut in "My Morning Straitjacket" and
            "Rubberneckers" where she wear skimpy outfit and catches the
            eye of many men. Also, Bullock (Stan's superior) likes to
            focus on her bust.
          + In "The Life Aquatic With Steve Smith" when Steve meets Amy, a
            girl that works on the school newspaper, he doesn't even
            bother trying to make eye contact with her.
     * Animaniacs doesn't have this as a rule - until Hello Nurse is on
       screen, at which point the trope is carried to parody levels. The
       handful of Minerva Mink shorts tended to use the trope straight (as
       a set-up for the Wild Take reactions of various male characters.)
     * A.T.O.M: The suiting up shots of the team show the guys putting on
       helmets and gloves, buckling seatbelts. Lioness? We get a worm's
       eye view shot from behind of her straddling her motorcycle or a
       close shot of her zipping her battle outfit over her bust.
     * Ty Lee in the Beach Episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
          + The eponymous Korra gets this [external_link.gif] ◊ in the
            earlier seasons of the Sequel Series, but it got toned down
            later.
     * In the original Biker Mice from Mars, one scene in the episode
       "Seeds of Victory" has Carbine standing in the foreground,
       resulting in a brief closeup of her hindquarters.
     * Interestingly on Captain Planet and the Planeteers, both the first
       shot of Linka in the first episode and the first shot of her in the
       opening of every episode is a pan up her legs...
     * In Castlevania Season 3 episode “The Harvest” there’s lingering
       shots of Sumi and Lenore’s bare breasts and nipples along with
       other shots of their nubile bodies while having sex with
       Alucard/Hector.
     * Probably unintentional, but at one point in the Danger Mouse reboot
       episode "Megahurtz Attacks" the camera seems to focus on Professor
       Squawkencluck's shapely backside (the context was that DM noticed a
       screwdriver in her back pocket that he needed).
     * Dexter's Laboratory:
          + Cameras don't hesitate to get as many shots from the back of
            Dexter's mom as they can; "Better Off Wet" in particular
            features her in a bikini.
          + Another memorable example is in the episode "Nuclear
            Confusion" where Dexter has to follow the clues for Dee Dee's
            treasure hunt. The next clue at the home of Dexter's
            "touchy-feely neighbor lady", who sports some very noticeable
            Hartman Hips. The neighbor offers him cookies, but drops one
            and bends to pick it up, showing the next clue is painted on
            the seat of her pants.
     * In My Life as a Teenage Robot the camera focuses on Jenny's behind
       after Tuck gets thrown a frisbee in "It Came from Next Door".
     * Constantly spoofed and played straight with Foxxy on Drawn
       Together, especially when she's been soaked with liquid.
     * Edward: In a Beach Episode, Edward stares at a buxom woman wearing
       a two-piece zebra-striped bikini. This doesn't go unnoticed by his
       wife.
     * Futurama veers into Male Gaze mode fairly often. The two female
       Planet Express employees - Amy and Leela - are both very shapely
       and often wear revealing outfits. It makes sense for Amy's
       character, but Leela's wardrobe is blatantly just there for
       Fanservice. The creators acknowledged in a commentary at one point
       that Amy was a sex symbol to the fans, joking that there was a
       fansite called Can't Get Enough Amy.
     * In the opening theme of Generator Rex, Dr. Holiday shows up after
       the camera pulls away from...you guessed it, her chest.
     * Glitch Techs: Shots of Miko often focus on her full hips and
       thighs.
     * In an episode of Inspector Gadget Gadget meets his favorite actress
       Lana Lamore he begins to examine her with gadget goggles he
       noticeably stops on her bust at one point and shouts his
       catchphrase "Wowzers!".
     * In the music video to "Ain't Nobody Better" in Jem, Pizzazz shakes
       her butt and the 'camera' zooms in on it.
     * The Jungle Show features some shots focusing on the curvaceous
       Jessica Cat's butt during her second song "Shining Knight".
     * Kim Possible has her fair amount of close-up buttocks shots and
       sometimes lingers on Shego.
     * In Loonatics Unleashed, the camera focuses on Lexi's behind as she
       walks after the commercial break in "A Creep in the Deep".
     * The "Spider-Baby" skit on MAD featured infant Peter Parker meeting
       his new babysitter, a full-grown Mary Jane. The camera (assumingly
       from Peter's POV) slowly closes in on her chest for two seconds as
       she asks "is somebody hungry?"
     * My Little Pony:
          + (Probably) Not in a sexual manner, but Razzaroo had many
            pictures involving shots of her friends' buttocks in the first
            My Little Pony (G3) special.
          + Also (probably) not intended in a sexual matter, but My Little
            Pony: Friendship Is Magic has a surprisingly high amount of
            pony buttocks (referred to by the Periphery Demographic as
            "plot"). Some of the animators may have become aware of this
            phenomena [external_link.gif] over the course of the series.
     * Spoofed in The Powerpuff Girls (1998). We never see Ms. Bellum's
       face, so when she speaks, the camera cuts to her chest. When
       Blossom switches bodies with her in "Criss Cross Crisis", the
       camera continues to obscure Ms. Bellum's face despite her now
       having the body of a kindergarten student. This trope was
       apparently why she was removed in the reboot; the writers didn't
       like the joke.
     * In the Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja episode "Let Them Eat Cake
       Fries", we get a close-up shot of the French Teacher's rather
       shapely butt [external_link.gif] from behind the desk. The focus on
       her butt was important enough to warrant smoother animation.
     * During the Regular Show episode "Slam Dunk", Margaret rides by the
       boys, and we are treated to a lingering gaze of her buttocks,
       complete with appropriate male gaze music.
     * Sanjay and Craig parodies this trope in the first episode, after
       Noodman gets his butt transplant [external_link.gif]
     * Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo:
          + At the beginning, the camera focused more on the butt of the
            birdwatcher's girlfriend than the monster that attacked her
            and her boyfriend.
          + When Velma finds Daphne practicing ballet, the camera really
            focuses on Daphne's back.
     * The Action-Hogging Opening of SilverHawks features a pan up the
       body of team Smurfette Steel Heart, with a fully detailed drawing
       of her cybernetic Amazonian Beauty.
     * Star Wars: The Clone Wars:
          + Padmé Amidala tends to get subjected to camera shots that
            focus on her very shapely rear end whenever she wears a very
            form fitting white bodysuit or some other outfits.
          + In the episode "Heroes on Both Sides", Ahsoka asks a
            Separatist boy around her age if she looks bad (as in the
            good/evil sense) to him. Cue the slow pan from legs to head
            and the obviously flirtatious response of "not bad at all."
            Ahsoka lampshades it on the spot.
          + In the Zygerian arc, Ahsoka dresses up in a rather fanservicey
            slave outfit that leaves her flat, glorious stomach and very
            nice legs exposed. Quite a few camera shots focus on her bare
            legs, with one giving an extremely close view of her thigh.
     * Steven Universe:
          + There are several moments where the camera pulls this on
            Pearl's backside, which is drawn a lot more shapelier than
            usual in those particular shots. Examples include the final
            act of "Laser Light Cannon" and, more blatantly, Amethyst's
            taunting in "Cat Fingers", where she morphs into Pearl, sticks
            out her rear and begins slapping it while going "Womp! Womp!".
          + The duet between Rose Quartz and her boyfriend Greg "What Can
            I Do For You?" contains several shots from Greg's POV that
            focus on Rose's lips.
     * Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures has the resident
       pop-idol Cherry Jam's music video, "Anything is Possible", and it
       really says something about this trope when the object of the
       camera's attention is a doll-like girl with no curves, but the
       camera still focuses on her chest, rear end, and lips for most of
       the song, often to the point of leaving her face out of the frame.
       [external_link.gif]
     * Who could forget the infamous "Shake It, Bake It, Booty Quake It"
       scene from Sym-Bionic Titan? The scene shows as much ass shaking,
       pole dancing, and bouncing as though giving a crazy-ass lap dance
       as you possibly can without being burned at the stake by soccer
       moms.
     * In the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles April and, sometimes,
       Karai are subject to this.
     * Tex Avery often played this for laughs (same as everything else).
       In Who Killed Who?, a flashlight spot scans a wall full of hanging
       pictures, including one of a scantily clad woman with a fur coat,
       but when the spot returns to the picture, the woman is covered up.
       Similarly, in The Shooting of Dan McGoo, the camera follows a mug
       of beer past a nude painting covered up by the bartender, who, when
       the camera comes back, states that he doesn't move for the rest of
       the picture. (When he does, however, the covered portion only has a
       sign saying "I ain't got no body.")
     * Total Drama has a lot of this, but the most noticeable is Courtney.
       Courtney gets a bunch of butt shots for no other reason besides
       Fanservice in every season in which she participates. It's
       especially noticeable when she does her Cheerleader bit. Heather
       and Zoey (in All-Stars) also.
     * In Totally Spies! about half the camera shots are focused on the
       girls' busts as they are about to speak or when they crash into
       each other. In the other half, the camera is often focused on their
       butts as they are lying on the floor or fighting.
     * In The Transformers episode "War Dawn", the camera focuses on
       Ariel's bottom when she charges at Megatron.
     * Arcee gets occasional aft shots in Transformers: Prime, most
       notably in the episodes "Predatory" and "Out of the Past".
     * T.U.F.F. Puppy has a close-up on Kitty Katswell's behind near the
       start of the episode "Puppy Unplugged".
     * In one episode of Winx Club, one scene cuts from a close up of a
       supporting character to a shot of Stella's rear as she is trying
       out a skirt. The transformations are full of these, especially the
       newest ones.

       Real Life
     * Science has proven it, therefore it must be real. It's actually one
       of the expressions of the reproductive instinct - big ass and big
       tits = a child born and nurtured healthily. This applies vice-versa
       too - females look at muscles because muscular, well-built male =
       safety and protection for the family.
     * A New York magazine article discussing flash mobs and other public
       pranks showed a picture of one of them, where a group of people all
       simultaneously took the Subway wearing no pants. Even though there
       are at least a half-dozen men in the picture, the camera is looking
       up the subway stairs at the one woman in lacy lingerie, naturally
       centered and in-focus.
     * According to this interview [external_link.gif] , Inoue Meimy has a
       Male Gaze. She says she likes females, but specifically through a
       Male Gaze and not a Female Gaze despite being female.
     * This [external_link.gif] footage of The Runaways begins with a
       five-second close-up of Cherie Currie's backside.
     * Happened to Peggy Bunker [external_link.gif] on The Daily Buzz
       while she was reading a story on breast implants, with some
       Tempting Fate beforehand and exasperated reaction afterward.
     * A Slate.com article [external_link.gif] about Alien (1979) chose as
       the header picture a shot of Ellen Ripley bending over in her
       panties. Amusingly, the text of the article notes how the film is
       over-analyzed as a piece of feminist art.
     * A particularly egregious example occurs in some of the 'Dolphina
       Belly-Dance' tutorial films. They're supposedly videos to instruct
       in the basics of belly-dance for fun and fitness, and the
       instructions are clearly pitched at women. The trouble is that they
       are filmed in this trope, so quite frequently Dolphina is
       instructing the viewer to do such-and-such with their feet, but the
       camera is too busy panning over her abs to show what the step is
       actually supposed to look like.
     * The infamous photo [external_link.gif] of Barack Obama and former
       French President Nicolas Sarkozy supposedly checking out a curvy
       Brazilian intern. When you watch the full video, however, it turns
       out Obama was actually in the middle of helping the girl behind him
       down the steep flight of stairs. Sarkozy, on the other hand...
     * A verbal example appeared in the 2013 Academy Awards, where host
       Seth MacFarlane sang a song called "We Saw Your Boobs,"
       highlighting the nude scenes of many of the actresses in the
       audience. Unfortunately, three or four of the scenes he mentioned
       were rape scenes. Also qualifies as Dude, Not Funny! (and as a
       Harsher in Hindsight, since one of the lyrics went "we haven't seen
       Jennifer Lawrence's boobs at all." That would change after Labor
       Day 2014, when the people who stole private pictures of her and
       many other female celebrities released them online).
     * This video [external_link.gif] , perhaps, has said EVERYTHING all
       men in the entire world want to say why they have this tendency,
       and why this trope even exists. Yes. Everything.
     * Ruth Orkin's 1951 photograph, American Girl in Italy
       [external_link.gif] , captured the moment when numerous Italian men
       flirted at Ninalee Craig (then known as Jinx Allen) while she
       visited Florence.
