The Gaze

Project 4-4: Gendering the Gaze

   Read the chapter by Laura Mulvey called Visual Pleasure and Narrative
   Cinema on pps 381 – 389 of the course reader making notes.

   Notes on the Gaze

   Sturken and Cartwright (2009) define the in relation to visual arts as:

   “the relationship of looking in which the subject is caught up in the
   dynamics of desire through trajectories of looking and being looked at
   among other people.” (Sturken and Cartwright, 2009: 442)

   The gaze can be both motivated by the subjects desire for control over
   the object it sees, and the object can likewise capture and hold the
   look.

   Pooke and Newall (2008) assert that in the field of art, gaze refers to
   the viewers engagement with the art object and is frequently suggestive
   of a power dynamic between the object and the spectator. The term Gaze
   is used prominently in film and gender studies.

   Modern origins of the gaze are based on psychoanalytic theory and
   relates to visual and sexual attentions and the implications of
   gendered human perception that these contain. Gazing is considered
   central to sexual attraction and has both a positive and negative
   identification, for example, narcissistic (loving/productive) and
   nihilistic (hating/destructive.)  (Harris, 2006)

   D’Alleva (2012) states:

   “Looking is powerful. To look is to assert power, to control, to
   challenge authority.” (D’Alleva, 2012: 104)

   A distinction is made between Gaze and gaze (lower case g): Gaze – the
   process of looking which constitutes a network of relationships, gaze –
   a specific instance of looking. Freud saw desire as crucial to the
   process of looking. Lacan saw the Gaze as one of the main
   manifestations of the four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis: the
   unconscious, repetition, transference and drive. For Lacan, the Gaze
   gives structure and stability to our fantasies of Self and Other.
   Looking at art is not a neutral process but one where the viewer is a
   desiring subject open to the captivation asserted by the work being
   viewed. The function of art is to trap the Gaze because the viewer is
   (falsely) put in the position of the eye.

   Film theorists of the 1970s (such as Laura Mulvey and Christian Metz)
   used the theories of Freud and Lacan to posit that in cinema the Gaze
   of the spectator on the image was implicitly male and objectified women
   on screen. Lacan’s analysis of the Gaze (for example, the mirror-phase)
   form an important part of feminist discussions of how women are
   constructed as the object of a ‘male gaze’ in film and visual arts with
   a particular feminist interest being the relations between looking,
   imagery and power in society.

   Notes on ‘Visual pleasure and narrative cinema’ by Laura Mulvey

   In ‘Visual pleasure and narrative cinema’, Laura Mulvey drew on
   psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Lacan to challenge patriarchal
   models of viewing. Hollywood cinema of the 1930s-50s was used to
   illustrate how pleasure in looking is split between the active/male
   protagonist/hero who possesses the Gaze and moves the action forward,
   and, the passive/female who is the object of the desire and the object
   of the Gaze.

   Arguing that Hollywood cinema is geared toward male viewing pleasure,
   and related directly to the construction of the male psyche. This both
   reinforced patriarchal society and Mulvey used the psychoanalytical
   paradigms of scopophillia, voyeurism and narcissism:

   Scopophillia – the pleasure in looking and being looked at
   (exhibitionism.) Pleasure in using another person as an object of
   sexual stimulation through sight. Active scopophillia implies a
   separation of erotic identity of the subject from the object on the
   screen. Is a function of sexual instincts.

   Voyeurism – the pleasure taken in looking while not being seen to be
   looking. This carries negative connotations of a powerful, even
   sadistic, position within the Gaze.

   Narcissism – identification with the image seen – linked to
   construction of the ego. Demands identification of the ego with the
   object in screen through the spectators fascination and recognition of
   his like. Is a function of the ego libido.

   Mulvey linked pleasure gained from the male gaze in three ways:
    1. Woman’s objectification in the gaze of the male characters and
       audience stimulates the pleasures of erotic fantasy.
    2. Identification with the male protagonist by male viewers links to
       the development of the ego – identified by Lacan as the
       mirror-phase: the stage which creates misrecognition in the child’s
       mind between the actual self and how he sees himself – the ego
       ideal.
    3. The male viewer, through the sadistic power of the male
       protagonist, is able to subdue the threat symbolised by the
       female’s lack of a penis – symbolic of castration. To avoid this
       anxiety the female figure is turned into a fetish/fetish object.

   Each of these strategies places the female in a position in which she
   has no control or agency: women are there to be looked at and the
   watching men project their fantasies onto the females portrayed on
   screen. The on screen male is a man of action and command which mirrors
   the underlying assumptions of a phallocentric and patriarchal society.
   Patriarchal culture positions woman as image and man as bearer of the
   image.

   Mulvey argued that the reason Hollywood cinema followed these
   conventions of gender roles (women as visual fetishes; spoken for,
   bearers of meaning, and, men as vigorous agents; speakers, makers of
   meaning) is because this is hard wired into the social psyche and thus
   unavoidable. When woman is referred to as the bearer of meaning this is
   a reference to the way a woman’s body is organised by Lacan’s concept
   of the signifier of difference – that is the penis she does not have
   marked by castration and the threat that she is. Her body, which is
   complete with beauty but damaged by phallic absence, is the fetish that
   makes the site of the lack – the difference that forms the possibility
   of meaning and on which language is built.

   A common criticism of Mulvey’s paper is that the Gaze she discusses is
   strictly male (also white and heterosexual) and this view does more to
   fix identity than free it. However, this misses the point that the
   essay is a polemic in which the male Gaze is a strategic necessity in
   order for Mulvey to make the case that although Hollywood narrative
   cinema appeared to be innocent entertainment it is really an instrument
   of patriarchal ideology. Despite what they term the “intellectual
   problems” of some aspects of Mulvey’s work, Lapsley and Westlake (2006)
   believe that her theories made a difference beyond academia as she
   rendered visible what had been invisible: the violence within
   representation and the reproduction of patriarchy within mainstream
   cinema. She revealed and confronted the self interested and misogynist
   nature of representations of women by white, middle class heterosexual
   males and contributed to the transformation of gender based relations
   of domination.

   Watch ‘Vertigo’ and make notes on how it stands up to Mulvey’s
   analysis.

   vertigo

   Scottie, The main protagonist of Vertigo is obsessed: he falls in love
   with a woman who apparently dies and seeing another woman who resembles
   her cannot help himself but remake the second in the image of the first
   – with eventual tragic results. (Hitchcock, in typically sardonic
   fashion, described the film as a twist on the Hollywood staple ‘boy
   meets girl, boy loses girl, boy meets girl again, boy loses girl again’
   Sammader, 2012) Under scrutiny it is a preposterous story and a
   commercial flop on release, now however it is regarded as a classic,
   possibly Hitchcock’s best film and was voted greatest film ever made by
   the BFI in 2012. Whether intentional or not Scottie’s moulding of Judy
   into the vision of Madeline has parallels with Hitchcock’s sadistic
   treatment of actors and his own obsession with a certain type of
   leading lady, a fetishised cool blonde. It could also be read as an
   analogy of the Hollywood star system in which the stars (especially the
   women) are no more than property to the studios.

   Themes of the film include desire and artificiality, subjectivity,
   female objectification and the male Gaze. Hitchcock was influenced by
   Freud and surrealism and draws on Freud’s theories of scopophillia.
   Stylistically the film is almost entirely shot from Scottie’s
   perspective with the audience becoming complicit in his voyeurism.
   Dreamy tracking shots are used in the sequences where he follows both
   Madeline and Judy, the camera moves with Scottie and reflect his
   snatched glimpses, wonderment and desire. The pastel colours of the
   films design give a overemphasised artificiality which add to the
   dreamlike quality. Occasionally our gaze is returned by Novak as
   Madeline/Judy – at these points we feel her accusing our voyeurism.
   Reflecting on Vertigo’s narrative, the entire film seems completely
   implausible, particularly why Madeline/Judy would allow herself to be
   first manipulated into Elster’s murderous scheme and then allow Scottie
   to change her appearance. The only logical explanation is that, as
   Mulvey argues, woman is presented as image and man as bearer of the
   look. This emphasises the inherent sexual imbalance in which the
   (active) determining male gaze projects its fantasy onto the female
   figure (passive) which is styled accordingly.

   Mulvey has the following to say about Vertigo: the look is central to
   the plot – oscillating between voyeurism and fetishist fascination.
   This is typical of Hitchcock with the male hero (James Stewart/Scottie)
   seeing exactly what the audience sees, his role being to portray the
   contradictions and tensions experienced by the spectator. The
   subjective camera of Vertigo predominates with the narrative being
   almost entirely based around what Scottie sees or fails to see – his
   erotic obsession and subsequent despair is shown entirely from his
   point of view. Scottie’s voyeurism is as blatant as is his sadistic
   side – he follows, watches and falls in love with a perfect image of
   female beauty and mystery. In the second half of the film his obsessive
   involvement with image is demonstrated as he tries to reconstruct Judy
   as Madeline and force her to conform to every detail of his fetish:
   “Her exhibitionism, her masochism make her an ideal counterpart to
   Scottie’s active, sadistic voyeurism.” (Jones, 2010: 64) His erotic
   interest can only be sustained with her playing and replaying her part,
   through repetition he breaks her down and exposes her guilt – his
   curiosity wins through and she is punished.

   “In Vertigo, erotic involvement with the look boomerangs: the
   spectator’s own fascination is revealed as illicit voyeurism as the
   narrative content enacts the processes and pleasures that he himself is
   exercising and enjoying.” (ibid)

   While Scottie is caught within the symbolic order with all of the
   attributes of the patriarchal super ego, the spectator is lulled into
   false security and exposed as complicit, caught in the moral ambiguity
   of looking: “Vertigo focuses on the implications of the active/looking,
   passive/looked at split in terms of sexual difference and the power of
   the male symbolic encapsulated in the hero.”

   How does the portrayal of some contemporary black music in video match
   up to Mulvey’s insights?

   Snoop Dogg feat Pharrell Drop It Like It’s Hot HD

   Contemporary black music – particularly rap music – has a reputation
   for being a macho domain where image is paramount and for treating
   women as little more the objects. I do not profess to be an expert on
   this style of music and spent sometime looking through various music
   videos on YouTube before coming across this video: ‘Drop it like it’s
   hot’ by Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell from 2009. Snoop Dogg is an artist
   who has been around for years and fulfils many of the stereotypes of
   what makes a rapper – glamourous surroundings, expensive consumer goods
   and a sexualised view of women. The women in this video are literally
   featured to be no more the glamourous window dressing, fawning and
   fussing over the stars in the video Snoop Dogg and Pharrell. They are
   shown dancing with the two male musicians, twerking next to a Rolls
   Royce, stripping, pouring drinks for Snoop Dogg and dancing together in
   a scene that could represent a club setting. They represent a juvenile
   wish fulfilment and are entirely there for the scopophillic pleasure of
   the (supposed) male viewer. The video is so outlandish and offensive
   that I would be inclined to think it is a parody, however, there is no
   sense of irony contained in it. As a final aside – I note that most
   versions of this video have the lyrics edited to remove potentially
   offensive words. An interesting choice to keep the visual content
   intact while censoring the lyrics of the song which shows the perceived
   power of words over images.

   Annotate  Manet’s  ‘Olympia’  in  terms  of  the  gaze  and  the
   various  characters, within and without the image.

   manet-olympia

   Manet’s ‘Olympia’ (1863) was considered scandalous and vulgar when
   first displayed, interestingly this has nothing to do with the model
   being nude but rather the unconventional subject depicted and her
   seemingly oppositional returned gaze. Rather than depicting an
   idealised subject based on history or myth as was the convention of
   nineteenth century painting, the model is a prostitute, and, most
   significantly, rather than complying with codes of humility and
   compliance her returned gaze is ambiguous and unsettling. Manet based
   the composition of the painting on Titian’s Venus of Urbino (1538) and
   comparing the two paintings emphasise the differences and why ‘Olympia’
   caused such controversy. Firstly the subject matter – Titian is
   depicting Venus, an ideal representation of the female form and
   sexuality while Manet has painted a courtesan, someone not normally
   presented in paintings. We can deduce ‘Olympia’ is a prostitute as this
   name was one often used for courtesans – the black cat shown at the
   bottom of the bed is a  symbol of prostitution. (As opposed to the dog
   shown in Titian’s painting which represents fidelity.) Both of the
   women in the picture are similarly undressed, reclining and holding one
   hand over their waist. Titian’s Venus is coy with her head cocked to
   one side. She has a look that could appear to be adoration or love,
   there is no sexual connotation to her pose and although she appears
   relaxed in her nakedness, the hand she holds over her genital area is
   appears to rest naturally rather than being held for any reasons of
   modesty. In ‘Olympia’ the model’s hand seems to be placed deliberately,
   again modesty is not the motivation here rather she is demonstrating
   control over her body. The position suggests that while her nakedness
   can be looked at for free, anything further will require payment.

   The most striking aspect of Manet’s painting, as previously mentioned,
   is the way the model in ‘Olympia’ returns our gaze. Unlike Titian’s
   model her head is held high and points directly out of the painting –
   there can be no doubt that the subject of her gaze is the viewer. This
   is further emphasised by the way the black servant in the painting is
   ignored despite appearing to bring a gift of flowers – her stare seems
   to challenge the viewer. Given the typical audience at the time would
   have been white, middle/upper class, western male this surely would
   have made them feel uncomfortable when confronted by the reality of a
   depiction of a ‘type’ they would not have been used to seeing
   represented in panting. The viewer is forced to confront their
   scopophillia along with the attendant feelings of shame that are linked
   to this.
