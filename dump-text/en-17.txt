   Much has been written about the male vs. the female gaze in art—most
   commonly in film, photography, literature, and figurative visual art—as
   a framework to understand the way an artist depicts another person as
   well as the effect that that depiction has on the viewer. Historically,
   we consider the male gaze as one that empowers men while objectifying
   and subjugating women for men’s pleasure. The female gaze casts women
   more frequently as subjects (instead of objects) and, in cases when
   women do appear as objects of attention or desire, it imbues them with
   agency and autonomy.

   But there’s a problem with this framework: it’s tied to the sex of the
   artist/storyteller. For example, I’ve read discussions about the female
   gaze that speak of women storytellers subverting the male gaze by
   objectifying the men in their stories as a way of taking back or
   flipping the narrative. I would argue that a simple role
   reversal—putting women behind the lens to subjugate men—does not change
   the nature of the gaze. Objectification, of anyone, is a quality of the
   male gaze.

   To go deeper into this conversation, we need to be thoughtful about the
   language we use. The terms “male” and “female” don’t actually work
   because they relate to limited understandings of biological sex, which
   is immaterial. Far more relevant to this discourse are the notions of
   masculine and feminine approaches to art making, which anyone,
   regardless of sex or gender, can employ.

   When we speak about the masculine and the feminine, we are speaking of
   universal forces that oppose and balance each other—much like yin and
   yang or Shiva and Shakti—and which exist in different iterations in
   cultures and mythologies throughout the world. The idea of a “male” or
   a “female” gaze propagates a false binary when, in fact, most artists
   use a mixture of masculine and feminine approaches to art making.

   By embracing a framework that identifies masculine and feminine
   approaches, it opens us up to consider how each of these qualities can
   affect the different facets and stages of the art making process—from
   the conception of a work to its creation and, ultimately, its final
   presentation.

   When I first started reviewing art, I was struck by the different ways
   that artists engage our attention. A more masculine final form offers
   the viewer something definitive and finite. I made this thing. Here you
   go. There’s a period at the end of the thought.

   Play-Doh by Jeff Koons (1994–2014) Aluminum.

   Jeff Koons is, to my mind, the poster boy for this type of
   presentation:1 Here’s a 12-foot-long stainless steel balloon dog!
   Here’s an 11-foot-high mash of Play-Doh that I paid other people to
   fabricate for me in aluminum! Here’s a billboard and some plastic
   sculptures depicting me and my wife fucking in lots of different
   positions!2 Certainly his works are feats of scale and construction,
   but never is he attempting to have a conversation with us. Never is he
   receptive to our response.

   Félix Gonzalez-Torres, “Untitled” (Portrait of Ross), 1991

   By contrast, a feminine presentation (or final form) asks more
   questions than it provides answers. The thought can only be completed
   by the viewer. My favorite example of this is Untitled (Portrait of
   Ross) by Félix Gonzalez-Torres. At first glance it seems similar in
   presentation to Koons’s: a heap of individually wrapped pieces of candy
   piled in the corner of a gallery. Something shiny for us to look at,
   right? Except that, upon investigation of the piece, the viewer
   discovers that the pile of candy weighs exactly 175 pounds, which was
   the healthy ideal weight of the artist’s partner, Ross Laycock, before
   he died of AIDS. The viewer is invited to take a piece of candy from
   the sculpture, thereby savoring the sweetness of Ross’s memory while,
   at the same time, causing the weight of the pile to diminish just as
   his body did while he was dying. And every night—or every few nights,
   depending on how many visitors come to the gallery—the museum staff
   re-weighs and replenishes the pile until it weighs 175 pounds again.
   So, by taking away a tiny piece of it, the viewer is also participating
   in a resurrection of sorts, a way to keep bringing back Ross’s memory.

   I’d been thinking for a long time about the masculine vs. the feminine
   in regard to the final form that art takes. But it wasn’t until
   recently, when I watched the film The Lost Daughter, that I became
   interested in—or began to understand—the ways that the masculine and
   the feminine show up in the process of creating work.

   The film itself—which you should watch it if you’re so inclined—is a
   revelation of the feminine gaze. The direction portrays each female
   character as both subject and object, and all are presented in a close,
   intimate, subjective style that is searching and elliptical and without
   straight answers.

   After seeing the film, I wanted to learn everything I could about how
   it was made, and was moved by what I found. To begin at the beginning:
   the movie is based on a book by an anonymous author who uses the nom de
   plume Elena Ferrante. The actor Maggie Gyllenhaal acquired the rights
   to the story without ever meeting, or even knowing the identity of,
   Ferrante. When inking the deal, Gyllenhaal mentioned that she might
   want to direct it, even though she’d never directed before. Ferrante
   granted her the rights to the material on the condition that Gyllenhaal
   direct it. If she didn’t, Ferrante stipulated, the contract would be
   void. The creation of the work depended upon the faith that one woman
   placed into the hands and heart of another.

   Later, Ferrante wrote an essay for The Guardian in which she talks
   about the process of letting go of her vision and embracing that of
   another woman: “I would never say to a woman director, ‘This is my
   book, this is my perspective. If you want to make a film, you have to
   stick to it.’ I wouldn’t say anything, even if she systematically
   betrayed my text, even if she wanted to use it simply as a launch pad
   for her own creative impulse…Part of me would like the story in
   Gyllenhaal’s images to adhere faithfully to my story, to never go
   outside the perimeter I drew. But my less primitive self knows that
   there’s something much more important at stake than this instinct to
   protect my own inventions. Another woman has found in that text good
   reason to test her creative capacities. Gyllenhaal has decided, that
   is, to give cinematic form not to my experience of the world but to
   hers.”

   I won’t quote the entire thing here (though it really is worth reading
   in its entirety), but suffice it to say that she offers a manifesto of
   what it looks like to empower and collaborate with other women in a
   male-dominated field.

   After the movie was released, Gyllenhaal described her role as a
   director like this, “I did definitely feel like—if you hire people who
   you're actually curious about and who you actually respect—a huge part
   of my job was to love them…and take care of them.” This was the first
   time I’d heard a filmmaker speak about care for others as an essential
   ingredient to the creative process. It inspired me to listen to more
   interviews with women directors.

   In a 2019 director’s roundtable for The Hollywood Reporter, the
   moderator asked the (mostly male) panel how they protect actors on
   emotionally heavy films to make sure no one is getting worn down. The
   men cited things like “information” and “rehearsal.” Ava DuVernay, one
   of only two women directors at the table, said that she makes sure to
   have counselors on set: “If anyone wants to talk afterward, if you just
   want to go cry, if you just want to sit alone…because when you're
   asking people to go to these depths you have to take care of them,” she
   said. One of the male directors—whose previous film had been about
   human torture—asked her, incredulously, “Did anyone ever use [the
   counselors]?” “Yep,” she replied. He remarked that he’d never heard of
   anything like that before. DuVernay hadn’t either—it isn’t standard
   practice—she was simply responding to the experiences of her
   collaborators. “I would talk with actors afterward and they would tell
   me how hard a time they had...that this had done something, some real
   damage. And I said, how can we correct this? Just from a place of good
   health,” she said.

   These are examples of feminine approaches to art making that any artist
   can embrace. And they provide us with a clearer understanding of how
   feminine and masculine elements can be consciously incorporated to
   create formidable bodies of work that are capable of supporting their
   makers as well as their audiences.

   This is by no means an exhaustive survey of this topic—I could easily
   write 10,000 more words on it—it’s simply a means to start a
   conversation about the fullness of the creative experience and the
   opportunities we have available to us to engage one another. By
   separating the sex and gender of the maker from what they create, and
   how they create it, we allow every artist to bring the suppressed
   feminine into greater balance with the masculine forces that have been
   dominant for so long.

   He is also, in my opinion, the great wool that the art world has pulled
   over its own eyes, but that’s a topic for another piece.

   I didn’t include a photo from that series because I like you. If you’re
   curious, you can google “Jeff Koons Made in Heaven.” But consider
   yourself warned.

   I am reminded of an audition process a conductor friend of mine once
   explained. The musician plays their instrument and chosen piece behind
   a screen. Hence no gaze and no gender-based decision on whom to hire.
   It becomes all about the music (art).

   So very insightful. Just READING The Description of meaning behind the
   175lb candy pile work made me go "awwwwhhh"! Will re-read your essay
   again and again and sit with it to investigate into my own reactions to
   art, as well as my own traits when creating a work. I love the M/F
   graph you made, want to use as an investigative tool for unpacking my
   ways of viewing, and creating, Art!
