The Female Gaze


   Written by Maddy Chelmis

   To gaze is to look, to observe. It appears simple in this context, we
   open our eyes and we look. But what do we see? How do we see it, and
   what do we do thereafter that impacts the way we look.

   Let me introduce firstly the familiar term ‘The Male Gaze’, coined by
   feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey in her 1975 essay Visual Pleasure
   and Narrative Cinema. The Male Gaze is commonly analysed in film,
   advertising and art. However it leaks into the everyday and influences
   many more elements of life beyond the screen and canvas. This is where
   it becomes even more dangerous. So, what is the Male Gaze? It is
   representative of the perspectives that are built from the
   hetero/cis-normative male world view. It involves the sexualisation and
   objectification of women. The world seen through a cis-het males eyes.
   It places the inherent value of a woman on her appearance, on how well
   she can mould herself into the patriarchal ideal of a woman.


   In an interview with Laura Mulvey on ‘Gender, Gaze and Technology in
   Film Culture’ she quotes “Women are represented as other.”[1] As well
   as “Women are seen and showed at the same time. Their appearance is so
   much coded for a strong visual and erotic impact that it can be argued
   that they connote the true essence of being seen.” This quote speaks
   volumes to me as it brings about the question “What does it mean to
   truly be seen?” Does being authentically seen really boil down to how a
   man perceives me? If so I’d rather be invisible… But of course this
   doesn’t have to be your truth. You ultimately decide what being seen is
   to you.


   I’m sure when I ask you to visualise the ‘ideal’ woman through a
   straight mans eyes we all get a similar image. Now that is very
   presumptuous of me, but I am confident in this assumption
   unfortunately. Why is this? Because from the time we were able to
   consume media with some semblance of consciousness we have been
   bombarded with films, art, adverts, comics, music, and other
   pop-culture that is littered with examples of the Male Gaze. No wonder
   it is so engrained in our minds, and thus seems so inescapable. But it
   is possible. Welcome in, The Female Gaze.

   Now contrary to the Male Gaze, the Female Gaze is a feminist film
   theoretical term representing the gaze of the female viewer, in case
   that wasn’t too obvious. Of course it is not limited to film alone.


   Let’s look at art. It unfortunately doesn’t take a highly skilled art
   critic or analyst to see that the majority of artworks in renowned
   galleries are by men, and the subjects, are oftentimes women, likely
   nude. Take the Guerrilla Girls and their infamous ‘Weenie counts’. In
   1989 they scoured the Metropolitan Museum of Art and counted the ratio
   of artworks produced by male and female artists. They found that 5% of
   artworks were produced by women, but 85% of the nudes were of female
   subjects. You see what we mean…?


   Here we have two examples of a female nude. One painted by a male
   baroque era artist, the other a more contemporary female artist.

   The Toilet of Venus, Diego Velázquez, 1647-51, Oil on canvas

   Secret Spaces, Joan Semmel, 1976

   I won’t go too in depth into both of these pieces, this isn’t an essay
   I’m afraid! But let’s look at some obvious differences in the depiction
   of both of these female bodies.

   The Toilet of Venus shows a white woman reclining elegantly on a bed of
   perfectly draped silk, admiring herself in a mirror held up by a
   bouncing little cherub. An everyday occurrence in 1647 I’m sure. In
   terms of looking, she is looking at herself, perpetuating the notion of
   vanity, of checking her appeal to the outside world. Her back is turned
   to the viewer, the viewer is looking AT her, but she is unaware. She is
   a spectacle unwillingly. She is smooth, has rippling curves in the
   patriarchal idea of the ‘right’ places. She is a vision, being looked
   at, looking at herself, because she has been painted according to the
   beauty standard.

   In an essay written by Eva K. Pankenier entitled ‘Patriarchy and the
   Female Sublime’ she quotes “The female body in its unaffected state is
   merely naked, but in the process of being depicted as art a
   “sublimation” occurs, in which the female naked becomes a socially
   acceptable female nude…this transformation is a shift from the actual
   to the ideal.”[2]

   Thus, here we are gazing upon the 1647 version of the photoshopped
   female body. Painted by, of course, a man.


   In stark contrast, Joan Semmel paints her own naked body. Not nude. But
   fully and authentically naked! The angle is literally from her
   perspective so this piece already has that going for it (quite the
   literal interpretation of the female gaze I know). It also showcases
   Semmel’s own body in its natural state. We have depictions of
   ‘unconventional’ aspects of the female form: stomach rolls, wrinkles
   and skin texture. How very refreshing! What is void here that is very
   present in The Toilet of Venus is the overt sexualisation of the female
   body.


   In essence the Female Gaze encapsulates everything that the Male Gaze
   is not.

   To me the Female Gaze is empathetic, and intimate. It doesn’t
   capitalise on the sexual nature of our bodies. It is about respect and
   realness, living in our bodies without the need to appease men or live
   up to an unrealistic standard because we feel we are being surveyed all
   the time.

   In his book Ways of Seeing John Berger quotes:


   “Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This
   determines not only most relations between men and women but also the
   relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is
   male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object, and
   most particularly an object of vision: a sight.”[3]


   This perfectly sums up the female experience. Feeling as though life is
   one big performance and you are constantly being watched. You must look
   good under the stage lighting, put on a smile for the camera, be best
   dressed in show etc. so what if we just stopped performing? Cut the
   cameras? Called curtain call?

   The best thing is: we can. It won’t be as easy as just doing it, it’ll
   take work and time, but we can switch the lens to the Female Gaze when
   we finally decide we are done entertaining ‘the crowd’ (being men).


   Now this topic could be a whole blog post on its own but it is
   extremely important to recognise that the Male Gaze and Female Gaze
   play into the prescribed gender binary. This is another topic that must
   be dismantled. But the topic poses the question, “Who do you perform
   your gender for?”. After scrolling through artist and author Florence
   Given’s Instagram I was left speechless at the realisation that a lot
   of the ‘femininity’ I present is in an effort to live up to the
   perceived feminine identity I am expected to adopt. When we erase
   gender from the conversation altogether it seems as though we are free
   from any particular  gaze. After all, gender is inherently performative
   and the societal norms that we deem to be ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’
   have been created by years and years of practiced actions, and rituals
   that fit into the specific gender binaries.

   So, to our trans and gender non-conforming community, we see you.
   Navigating a world in which the media around us is predominantly
   presented as from the Straight Male lens is isolating, and while it is
   getting better, it is high time that we really opened our eyes and
   looked at the world through everyone’s eyes to breed a more inclusive
   and safe place to live in.


   In conclusion, while the Male Gaze is still ever-present in our
   society, it is possible to escape it and reframe your world through
   your own eyes. Ask yourself, how would your life look if you were only
   concerned about your gaze? If you saw yourself as the main character
   and nobody else’s perceptions of you mattered. With a lot of hard work
   that reality is possible. But it takes a lot of self reflection, and
   ultimately the dismantling of the patriarchy… But we’ll get there
   eventually!
