NewsroomWhat is Eye Gaze Technology?

   3/5/2018

   It is an electronic device that allows a person to control a computer
   or tablet by looking at words or commands on a video screen. A very low
   intensity light shines into one of the user’s eyes. A television camera
   picks up reflections from the cornea and retina. As the direction of
   the person’s gaze moves, the relative position of the two reflections
   changes, and the computer uses this information to determine the area
   at which the person is looking. The computer then executes the selected
   command.

   This technology is used for people who cannot control a computer or a
   tablet by standard methods such as a keyboard or a mouse. The staff at
   the Solution Outreach Center at OCCK, Inc. have used this technology
   with people as young as 9 months to senior citizens. Our customers are
   using it for communication, educational programs, email, Facebook,
   reading a book, exploring the Internet and turning on their TV.
   Currently we have the PCEye Mini, and myGaze Eye Tracker. Information
   on these two devices is below, other companies also have eye gaze
   technology.

   If you would like more information on this technology or would like to
   request a demonstration, please call the Solution Outreach Center at
   OCCK, Inc. 785-827-9383 or 1-800-526-9731 or your nearest Assistive
   Technology Access Site 1-800-526-3648.
   PCEye Mini
   The PCEye Mini replaces the standard keyboard and mouse, allowing you
   to navigate and control your laptop or small screen desktop computer
   using only your eyes.

   myGaze Eye Tracker
   With simple USB connection to your device, myGaze Eye Tracker provides
   accurate eye tracking and cursor control. An elegant but robust
   solution for all individuals, whether learning early eye gaze skills or
   accessing all areas of the computer.
