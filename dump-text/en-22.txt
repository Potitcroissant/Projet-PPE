   Ocular Motility Photography

   The term ocular motility refers to the study of the twelve extraocular
   muscles and their impact on eye movement. Each eye has six muscles,
   four rectus and two oblique, which, when functioning properly, allow
   the eyes to work together in a wide range of gaze.

                          Muscles of the Right Eye

   Patients are usually tested for eye position and movement during a
   routine eye examination. To observe the action of all twelve muscles,
   the patient is asked to look in the 9 diagnostic positions of gaze. The
   patient follows a target to various points of gaze while the physician
   closely monitors their eye movements. Any noted limitation or
   misalignment of the eyes could indicate muscle weakness or paralysis
   and warrant further investigation.

                       9 Diagnostic Positions of Gaze



   Normal alignment on forward gaze

                          Deviation on upward gaze

   Ocular motility photographs may be requested in order to document any
   improper muscle action. These images can be used to reinforce the
   physician's clinical impression, for medical-legal reasons or as a
   starting point prior to muscle surgery. Patients with strabismus and
   those diagnosed with cranial nerve palsies are good candidates for
   motility documentation.

   Strabismus

   Strabismus is a generic term used to describe any misalignment of the
   eyes often due to an imbalance of the extraocular muscles. This
   misalignment may develop at any age and occur in any direction.
   However, strabismus can be especially harmful to the development of
   vision in young children. If not diagnosed and treated early, visual
   acuity could be irreversibly damaged.

                            "V" Pattern Esotropia


                        Pre-operative Motility Series

                       Post-operative Motility Series

   Cranial Nerve Palsies

   Because the brain controls eye movement through a series of cranial
   nerves, observing ocular movements can often give clues to help
   diagnose central nervous system disorders. The III, IV and VI cranial
   nerves are used to control the extraocular muscles, thereby controlling
   eye movement. If any of these cranial nerves are compromised, ocular
   motility photographs will document the affected muscles limited
   movement.

   Equipment and Technique

   Despite the overwhelming popularity of digital photography, motility
   images can be captured using either a film or digital camera. Although
   getting the end result may differ between the two modalities, the
   camera techniques for capturing the images are the same. The equipment
   list and method for making composites are different, but the techniques
   for acquiring the images remain the same.

   Equipment for film imaging:
     * 35mm SLR camera
     * 105mm lens
     * Flash unit (camera mounted) or studio strobe
     * 100 ISO film

   Equipment for digital imaging:
     * Digital SLR camera
     * 85mm lens
     * 105mm (full chip)
     * Flash unit (camera mounted) or studio strobe

   When using a 35mm film camera and a 105mm lens, set the lens to a ratio
   of 1:4. This is the typical magnification used to photograph both eyes
   simultaneously. With a digital SLR, the exact magnification will be
   dependant on the size of the image sensor. For a digital camera with
   less than a full sensor, your lens should be set to a ratio of around
   1:5. Full sensor cameras can be set at 1:4. There can be a slight
   variance in the exact ratio, but once chosen, the ratio should remain
   same for all patients on that particular camera. This will ensure
   images of the patient shot today will have the same magnification when
   they come back, whether it be in three months or in 3 years.

   Focusing with either system can be accomplished by moving forward and
   back from the subject (rocker focusing). While looking through the
   viewfinder, the photographer needs to sure the subject properly aligned
   in the frame. The camera should be positioned squarely in front of the
   subject and the eyes should be parallel in the viewfinder. Replacing
   the ‘generic' focusing screen with a grid focusing screen will help
   keep things straight.

                            Grid Focusing Screen

   Once the subject is in focus and properly positioned in the frame,
   direct the patient to look in the 9 diagnostic gazes and photograph
   each one. Having a target for the patient to fixate on will help them
   focus their gaze in the proper direction. The nine gazes are: straight
   ahead, left, right, straight up, up and to the left, up and to the
   right, straight down, down and to the left, down and to the right. To
   get an unobstructed view of the eyes in the downgaze positions, have
   the patient or better yet, a helper, elevate the patient's upper lids.

   Uniform picture quality is very important, so always be aware of
   composition throughout the series. Patient head movement should be kept
   to a minimum. Instruct them to keep their head straight and use only
   their eyes to follow the target. A chin and headrest may be used to
   position the patient while doing the series. When photographing
   children, having them sit on their parents lap may be helpful. Movement
   can be minimized by having the parent gently hold the child's head in
   the forward position.

                              9 Gaze Composite

   Once a 9 gaze series is completed, a composite image showing all nine
   views is often requested. How you create this image depends on the
   equipment at your disposal.

   Since digital photography is by far the most popular method of image
   capture, any of the popular image management software, such as Adobe
   Photoshop, can create a nine gaze composite. While these programs will
   differ slightly in the step by step process, creating a digital
   composite is usually a ‘copy and paste' process. Some programs will
   allow you to create a ‘template' that can be opened every time you need
   to create the composite image. If you are use a digital retinal imaging
   system, you may be able to import your images into the program and
   create a 9 up.

   With a film based camera, the easiest way to produce a composite image
   is to use negative film for the original photography, then
   re-photographing the prints. After photographing the 9 diagnostic
   gazes, have the lab make 2" x 3" prints from the negatives. The prints
   can then be placed in their proper order into a nine sectioned, plastic
   file page. Then simply make a photographic copy of the entire page with
   a digital camera and you will have created a composite image.

   A flat bed scanner can also be used to create a composite image. Lay
   the 9 print images into position, then create a pre-scan image using
   your scanning software. If the initial scan is of good quality, crop
   the image to size and make your final scan.

   Regardless of which option works best in your situation, once
   completed, your new composite image can now saved as a digital file,
   emailed or printed in hard copy form.
