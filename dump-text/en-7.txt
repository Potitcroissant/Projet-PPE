   The “gaze” is a term that describes how viewers engage with visual
   media. Originating in film theory and criticism in the 1970s, the gaze
   refers to how we look at visual representations. These include
   advertisements, television programs and cinema.

   When film critics talk about the gaze, they are often referring to the
   “male gaze”. But what does that really mean? And is there a female
   equivalent?

Where did the idea of a ‘male gaze’ come from?

   The “male gaze” invokes the sexual politics of the gaze and suggests a
   sexualised way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women. In
   the male gaze, woman is visually positioned as an “object” of
   heterosexual male desire. Her feelings, thoughts and her own sexual
   drives are less important than her being “framed” by male desire.

   A key idea of feminist film theory, the concept of the male gaze was
   introduced by scholar and filmmaker Laura Mulvey in her now famous 1975
   essay, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.

   Adopting the language of psychoanalysis, Mulvey argued that traditional
   Hollywood films respond to a deep-seated drive known as “scopophilia”:
   the sexual pleasure involved in looking. Mulvey argued that most
   popular movies are filmed in ways that satisfy masculine scopophilia.

   Although sometimes described as the “male gaze”, Mulvey’s concept is
   more accurately described as a heterosexual, masculine gaze.

   Visual media that respond to masculine voyeurism tends to sexualise
   women for a male viewer. As Mulvey wrote, women are characterised by
   their “to-be-looked-at-ness” in cinema. Woman is “spectacle”, and man
   is “the bearer of the look”.

   The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) offers a famous example of the
   male gaze. In the scene below, the audience is introduced to Cora
   Smith, the film’s lead female character. Using close-ups, the camera
   forces the viewer to stare at Cora’s body. It creates a mode of looking
   that is sexual, voyeuristic, and associated with the male protagonist’s
   point-of-view.

   It also establishes some important plot points: that the hero desires
   Cora, and that Cora recognises his lust. But the strongest message is
   that Cora is sexy. Indeed, the viewer learns that Cora is sexy before
   they even learn her name. Even if a viewer isn’t attracted to women in
   “real life”, the scene still makes sense. A lifetime of seeing women
   sexualised in television, music videos and advertisements has made us
   very comfortable with assuming the male gaze.

Finding the male gaze

   The male gaze takes many forms, but can be identified by situations
   where female characters are controlled by, and mostly exist in terms of
   what they represent to, the hero. As Budd Boetticher, who directed
   classic Westerns during the 1950s, put it:

     What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she
     represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires
     in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act
     the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest
     importance.

   This can be see in the different ways the camera repeatedly positions
   us to look at women’s bodies. Think of Rear Window (1954), for a
   literal framing of women’s bodies, or She’s All That (1999), which
   revolves around a make-over. For a modern example, the Transformers
   film series (2006-2014) presents women as sexual objects to be desired.

   Filmmakers often attempt to avoid presenting female characters as
   “mere” sexual objects by giving them complex back stories, strong
   motivations and an active role in the plot of their story. Yet the
   masculine gaze is still commonplace. Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises
   (2012) has significant personal motivations, yet she is still clearly
   there to be looked at.

Different ways of looking

   Although written 40 years ago, Mulvey’s essay still provokes strong
   reactions. One common response is that both women and men are
   objectified in cinema.
   Gilda (1946). CBC

   After all, isn’t Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) as sexy as Gilda Mundson
   (Rita Hayworth) in Gilda (1946)?

   Isn’t Fitzwilliam Darcy as beautiful as Elizabeth Bennet in the BBC
   teleseries of Pride and Prejudice (1995)? Surely this indicates the
   presence of a (heterosexual) female gaze.

   Such arguments don’t consider how insistently women are presented as
   sexual objects.

   The Hawkeye Initiative is a project that draws attention to the
   different ways male and female superheroes are posed in comics and
   movies. Take this illustration as an example, which poses the male
   heroes of The Avengers in the same hyper-sexualised position as the
   film’s sole female protagonist, Black Widow.
   How the Avengers might look if the male gaze was also applied to them,
   according to The Hawkeye Initiative.

   The illustration makes a good point about double standards. But its
   humour derives from the fact that it is unusual to see men sexualised
   in the same way as women.

   Another argument is that cinema doesn’t invite women to desire men’s
   bodies. Rather, female viewers are positioned to identify with a
   heroine who is herself desired by a man. According to this logic, it is
   not Fitzwilliam Darcy’s wet undershirt that inflames the female viewer
   in Pride and Prejudice. Rather, it is Darcy’s longing for Elizabeth
   that truly appeals.

Is there a female gaze?

   Many films that represent women’s desire do so in “non gaze”-related
   ways. Jane Campion’s The Piano (1993) expresses the heroine’s
   passionate nature through the film’s famous score.

   Sofia Coppola’s The Virgin Suicides (1999) conveys female experience
   through sound and visual aesthetics, portraying the teenage
   protagonists’ inner life. This scene uses warm tones (yellow, salmon),
   feminine symbols (flowers, unicorns) and music to express female
   adolescence.

   The Virgin Suicides (1999).

   Coppola uses a similar strategy in Marie Antoinette (2006), using
   florid set design to communicate women’s claustrophobic life at
   Versailles.

   The argument that women’s desire is best expressed through sensation
   rather than a gaze may evoke the cliché that male desire is “visual”
   whereas women’s is “sensory”. But men’s inner lives have always been
   conveyed via sound and sensation. Action films like Rambo (2008) or
   Casino Royale (2006), for example, bombard the senses with male anguish
   and aggression.

   So is there a female gaze? Certainly, beautiful men abound in cinema.
   But I’d argue that there is no direct female equivalent of the male
   gaze. The male gaze creates a power imbalance. It supports a
   patriarchal status quo, perpetuating women’s real-life sexual
   objectification.

   For this reason, the female gaze cannot be “like” the male gaze.

   Instead, films that centre women’s experiences are deeply subversive.
   Think of Fish Tank (2009), a coming-of-age story about a disadvantaged
   girl’s vulnerability, or In the Cut (2003), a story about a woman’s
   sexual discovery.

   Films about women’s sexuality often face censorship ways that prove
   their subversiveness. For instance, the makers of The Cooler (2003),
   Boys Don’t Cry (1999) and Blue Valentine (2010) claim that their films
   were rated R or NC-17 for depicting cunnilingus. Such scenes focus on
   female pleasure and undermine women’s “to-be-looked-at-ness”.
   Censorship bodies like the Motion Picture Association of America,
   however, seem to treat cunnilingus as “more graphic” than other forms
   of sex.

   Films like The Piano, In The Cut or Marie Antoinette show that cinema
   can use music, erotic scenes and visual aesthetics to express a
   feminine point of view. In doing so, such films counter the gaze,
   depicting women as subjects rather than objects “to be looked at”.
   Whilst not replicating the male gaze exactly, they challenge the
   enduring dominance of masculine worldviews in film and media.
