   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   For other uses, see Gaze (disambiguation).

   The term gaze is frequently used in physiology to describe coordinated
   motion of the eyes and neck. The lateral gaze is controlled by the
   paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF).^[1] The vertical gaze is
   controlled by the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal
   fasciculus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.^[2]

Nerves and muscles

   [edit]

   The three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the
   oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which are the third,
   fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. the abducens nerve is responsible for
   abducting the eye, which it controls through contraction of the lateral
   rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve controls the superior oblique muscle
   to rotate the eye along its axis in the orbit medially, which is called
   intorsion, and is a component of focusing the eyes on an object close
   to the face. The oculomotor nerve controls all the other extraocular
   muscles, as well as a muscle of the upper eyelid.^[3]

Conjugate gaze

   [edit]

   The conjugate gaze is the motion of both eyes in the same direction at
   the same time, and conjugate gaze palsy refers to an impairment of this
   function. The conjugate gaze is controlled by four different
   mechanisms:^[4]
     * the saccadic system that allows for voluntary direction of the gaze
     * the pursuit system that allows the subject to follow a moving
       object
     * nystagmus which includes both vestibular nystagmus and optokinetic
       nystagmus. The vestibular system restores gaze in compensation for
       the rotation of the head whereas the optokinetic system restores
       gaze despite movements of the outside world.
     * the vestibulo-ocular reflex system (VOR system) that corrects for
       the movements of the head to preserve the stable visual image of
       the world
