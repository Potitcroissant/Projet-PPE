Look at My Eyes: Reading gaze in paintings

   Gustave Moreau (1826–1898), Oedipus and the Sphinx (detail) (1864), oil
   on canvas, 206.4 x 104.8 cm, The Metropolitan Museum of Art (Bequest of
   William H. Herriman, 1920), New York, NY. Courtesy of The Metropolitan

   Many paintings rely on quite subtle clues as to their reading. Is that
   figure simply a portrait, or are they intended to tell us more, even
   refer to a narrative? What’s going on in this group of people, general
   hubbub or is there something more? In this article I’m going to look at
   the direction of gaze, and tomorrow at hands and gestures such as
   pointing.

   Being visual art, paintings often are at least partly about, or refer
   to, the act of looking. For most painters, this is a central concern in
   their figurative works. A single figure shown looking straight at the
   viewer, or (in more recent paintings in particular) with a fixed gaze
   at an object outside the picture, is most likely to have been posed for
   a straight portrait. Once their gaze is directed at an object or
   another figure, there’s likely to be something else going on.

   (1755–1842), Life Study of Lady Hamilton as the Cumaean Sybil (1792),
   oil on canvas, 73 x 57.2 cm, Private collection. Wikimedia Commons.

   The gaze of a single figure can carry important meaning, as in Louise
   Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun’s Life Study of Lady Hamilton as the Cumaean
   Sybil from 1792. Coupled with her ‘eastern’ headdress, distinctive
   robes and scroll, her heavenly gaze tells us that she is under divine
   inspiration.
   noursemotherhood Elizabeth Nourse (1859–1938), Motherhood (1897), oil
   on canvas, 87.6 x 66.7 cm, Private collection. The Athenaeum.

   Mothers and their children are another good example, whether in
   religious paintings of the Virgin Mary and infant Christ, or Elizabeth
   Nourse’s superb Motherhood from 1897. Closer reading reveals that the
   mother here isn’t a conventional subject either: her face is tanned
   from outdoor work, and her hands have clearly toiled long and hard in
   the soil.

   Metropolitan Museum of Art, via Wikimedia Commons.

   One of the most intense painted gazes is that between Gustave Moreau’s
   Oedipus and the Sphinx (1864), which stands in stark contrast to that
   of mother and infant. These two are right in one another’s face,
   staring one another out. The Sphinx is already latched onto what she
   assumes will be her next and delectable young meal, and promises to be
   femme fatale for the young man.

   Oedipus knows that he cannot falter. A false guess in his answer to the
   Sphinx’s riddle, even a slight quaver in his voice, and this beautiful
   but lethal beast will be at his throat. His left hand clenches his
   javelin, knowing that what he is about to say should save his life, and
   spare the Thebans. He will then no longer be pinned with his back to
   the rock, and the threat of the Sphinx will be gone.

   Commons.

   With larger groups, it’s worth taking the time to consciously examine
   the gaze of each face you can see in the painting.
   fantinlatourhomagedelacroix1864 Henri Fantin-Latour (1836–1904), Homage
   to Delacroix (1864), oil on canvas, 160 x 250 cm, Musée d’Orsay, Paris.
   Image by Sailko, via Wikimedia Commons.

   If it’s just a group portrait, as in Henri Fantin-Latour’s Homage to
   Delacroix from 1864, then it’s down to identifying the individuals and
   their setting. Without interactions between the figures, this is a
   collection of eleven individual portraits.
   IF Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904), Phryné before the Areopagus (1861),
   oil on canvas, 80 x 128 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg, Germany. Wikimedia
   Commons.

   In Jean-Léon Gérôme’s Phryné before the Areopagus from 1861, the elders
   of the court are, almost without exception, staring at the naked body
   of the highly successful and very rich courtesan (hetaira) who has been
   brought to trial before them for the serious crime of impiety. Their
   faces (below) respond with emotions ranging from pure fright, to
   anguish, grief, or disbelief – but they can’t take their eyes off her.
   She has responded by turning away from them and covering her eyes.

   When it seemed inevitable that Phryné would be found guilty, one of her
   lovers, the orator Hypereides, took on her defence. A key part of that
   was to unveil her naked in front of the court, in an attempt to
   surprise its members, impress them with the beauty of her body, and
   arouse a sense of pity. The legend claims that this ploy worked
   perfectly, and with his skill in using gaze, Gérôme’s painting makes
   that crystal clear.
   geromephrynerevealedd2 Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904), Phryné before the
   Areopagus (detail) (1861), oil on canvas, 80 x 128 cm, Kunsthalle
   Hamburg, Germany. Wikimedia Commons.

   Sometimes the importance of gaze lies in what the figures are not
   looking at.
   delarocheassassinationdukedeguise Paul Delaroche (1797–1856), The
   Assassination of the Duke of Guise in the Château de Blois in 1588
   (1834), oil on canvas, 57 x 98 cm, Musée Condé, Chantilly, France.
   Wikimedia Commons.

   In Paul Delaroche’s account of The Assassination of the Duke of Guise
   in the Château de Blois in 1588, painted in 1834, the artist has
   divided his canvas in two. On the right, the Duke of Guise lies, dead,
   in a melodramatic posture with his arms outstretched, at the foot of a
   bed. At the left, a group of men are talking with one another, most
   clutching their swords, but none paying the slightest attention to
   Guise’s body, as if it was not there.

   This assassination, and that of Guise’s brother, the Cardinal of Guise,
   the following day resulted in such outrage among the Guise family that
   Henry III, who was largely responsible, had to flee and take refuge
   with Henry of Navarre. The following year Henry III was assassinated by
   an agent of the Catholic League.

   Some of the most fascinating paintings feature complex chains of gaze
   which need more careful study.
   corinthsalome1900 Lovis Corinth (1858–1925), Salome (II) (1900), oil on
   canvas, 127 × 147 cm, Museum der Bildenden Künste Leipzig, Leipzig.
   Wikimedia Commons.

   One my favourites among these is Lovis Corinth’s second and more
   finished version of Salome from 1900.

   Salome is staring intently at the lower abdomen of the executioner. Her
   right hand is stretching open the left eye of the severed head of John
   the Baptist, which appears to be staring up at her. The executioner and
   the young woman at the top right are laughing at one another, but a
   third woman beside her has a serious, almost sad expression, as she
   stands holding a very large peacock fan.
   corinthsalome1900d1 Lovis Corinth (1858–1925), Salome (II) (detail)
   (1900), oil on canvas, 127 × 147 cm, Museum der Bildenden Künste
   Leipzig, Leipzig. Wikimedia Commons.

   The chain of gaze here is central to the painting’s narrative: John’s
   eye stares at Salome, who stares at the executioner’s crotch, who
   laughs at the young woman at the top right, who laughs back at him.
   Watching sombre and detached from behind is the figure of death.

   I end this article with three paintings in which gaze is complex. Two
   probably don’t contain any particular meaning, but the third is one of
   the greatest masterpieces in the history of painting in Europe.
   westwreatyofpenn Benjamin West (1738–1820), The Treaty of Penn with the
   Indians (1771-72), oil on canvas, 190 x 274 cm, Pennsylvania Academy of
   the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. Wikimedia Commons.

   Benjamin West’s The Treaty of Penn with the Indians or William Penn’s
   Treaty with the Indians was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772.
   This shows the founder of the state of Pennsylvania purchasing land for
   his colony from the Lenape people, with a treaty of peace between the
   colonists and the ‘Indians’, in 1682. Looking at the directions of gaze
   of its figures suggests that the artist had no consistent idea of where
   they should be looking, and the viewer is even hard-put to identify its
   central figure William Penn.
   fantinlatouraroundpiano Henri Fantin-Latour (1836–1904), Around the
   Piano (1885), oil on canvas, 160 x 222 cm, Musée d’Orsay, Paris. Image
   by Jean-Pierre Dalbéra, via Wikimedia Commons.

   The sixth and last of Henri Fantin-Latour’s group portraits, Around the
   Piano from 1885, shows members of a Wagner fan club in Paris at the
   time. They are each gazing at something different and not interacting
   in the least. Emmanuel Chabrier is playing the piano without looking at
   its keyboard or the music, and its other figures (bar one) appear
   distracted.

   Not so for the members of the Spanish royal court in Diego Velázquez’s
   Las Meninas from about 1656-57.

   velazquezlasmeninas Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), Las Meninas (The Maids
   of Honour, Velázquez and the Royal Family) (c 1656-57) [119], oil on
   canvas, 318 x 276 cm, Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, Spain.
   Wikimedia Commons.In what is overtly a portrait of eleven people and a
   dog in a room in the Alcázar Palace, Velázquez uses composition and
   gaze to tell us much more. Much depends on what we believe most of the
   figures are looking at. Reflected in the rectangular plane mirror on
   the far wall are King Philip IV and his wife Queen Mariana of Austria.

   There has been dispute over whether the reflection shows the royal
   couple stood where the viewer is, or the mirror is reflecting their
   painted images on Velázquez’s canvas. How their images were generated
   is probably of secondary importance, as either way the gaze of most of
   the other figures is clearly directed not at the viewer, but at the
   King and Queen, who may be getting up to leave after sitting for
   Velázquez to paint them.

   velazquezlasmeninasd1 Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), Las Meninas (The
   Maids of Honour, Velázquez and the Royal Family) (detail) (c 1656-57)
   [119], oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cm, Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid,
   Spain. Wikimedia Commons.That must be one of the most subtle and
   complex uses of gaze in a painting.

   Tomorrow I look at hands, pointing, and other gestures we can make with
   them.

        Thanks.
            An outstanding painting, of course, but not I think a
            difficult gaze to read. She’s looking directly at the viewer.
            There’s nothing to suggest that she’s looking at anything
            else. Her gaze indicates that this is first and foremost a
            portrait – she posed for the painting, rather than being
            caught ‘unawares’ doing something else, as with many of
            Vermeer’s other single-figure paintings, such as The Milkmaid.
            How you read the rest of that painting is far more complex,
            but there isn’t a great deal more that you can get from the
            direction of her gaze itself, as far as I’m aware.
            Howard.
